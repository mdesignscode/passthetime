the mourning dove\nPours down the murmuring grove his plaintive croon\nThat like the voice of visionary love\nOft have I risen to seek through this green maze\n(Even as my feet thread now the great world's garden-ways);\n\nAnd, parting tangled bushes as I passed\nDown beechen allies beautiful and dim,\nPerhaps by some deep-shaded pool at last\nMy feet would pause, where goldfish poise and swim,\nAnd snowy callas' velvet cups are massed\nAround the mossy, fern-encircled brim.\nHere, then, that magic summoning would cease,\nOr sound far off again among the orchard trees.\n\nAnd here where the blanched lilies of the vale\nAnd violets and yellow star-flowers teem,\nAnd pink and purple hyacinths exhale\nTheir heavy fume, once more to drowse and dream\nMy head would sink, from many an olden tale\nDrawing imagination's fervid theme,\nOr haply peopling this enchanting spot\nOnly with fair creations of fantastic thought.\n\nFor oft I think, in years long since gone by,\nThat gentle hearts dwelt here and gentle hands\nStored all this bowery bliss to beautify\nThe paradise of some unsung romance;\nHere, safe from all except the loved one's eye,\n'Tis sweet to think white limbs were wont to glance,\nWell pleased to wanton like the flowers and share\nTheir simple loveliness with the enamored air.\n\nThrice dear to them whose votive fingers decked\nThe altars of First Love were these green ways,\nThese lawns and verdurous brakes forever flecked\nWith the warm sunshine of midsummer days;\nOft where the long straight allies intersect\nAnd marble seats surround the open space,\nWhere a tiled pool and sculptured fountain stand,\nHath Evening found them seated, silent, hand in hand.\n\nWhen twilight deepened, in the gathering shade\nBeneath that old titanic cypress row,\nWhose sombre vault and towering colonnade\nDwarfed the enfolded forms that moved below,\nOft with close steps these happy lovers strayed,\nTill down its darkening aisle the sunset glow\nGrew less and patterning the garden floor\nFaint flakes of filtering moonlight mantled more and more.\n\nAnd the strange tempest that a touch imparts\nThrough the mid fibre of the molten frame,\nWhen the sweet flesh in early youth asserts\nIts heyday verve and little hints enflame,\nDisturbed them as they walked; from their full hearts\nWelled the soft word, and many a tender name\nStrove on their lips as breast to breast they strained\nAnd the deep joy they drank seemed never, never drained.\n\nLove's soul that is the depth of starry skies\nSet in the splendor of one upturned face\nTo beam adorably through half-closed eyes;\nLove's body where the breadth of summer days\nAnd all the beauty earth and air comprise\nCome to the compass of an arm's embrace,\nTo burn a moment on impassioned lips\nAnd yield intemperate joy to quivering finger-tips,\n\nThey knew; and here where morning-glories cling\nRound carven forms of carefullest artifice,\nThey made a bower where every outward thing\nShould comment on the cause of their own bliss;\nWith flowers of liveliest hue encompassing\nThat flower that the beloved body is\nThat rose that for the banquet of Love's bee\nHas budded all the æons of past eternity.\n\nBut their choice seat was where the garden wall,\nCrowning a little summit, far and near,\nLooks over tufted treetops onto all\nThe pleasant outer country; rising here\nFrom rustling foliage where cuckoos call\nOn summer evenings, stands a belvedere,\nBuff-hued, of antique plaster, overrun\nWith flowering vines and weatherworn by rain and sun.\n\nStill round the turrets of this antique tower\nThe bougainvillea hangs a crimson crown,\nWistaria-vines and clematis in flower,\nWreathing the lower surface further down,\nHide the old plaster in a very shower\nOf motley blossoms like a broidered gown.\nOutside, ascending from the garden grove,\nA crumbling stairway winds to the one room above.\n\nAnd whoso mounts by this dismantled stair\nFinds the old pleasure-hall, long disarrayed,\nBrick-tiled and raftered, and the walls foursquare\nRinged all about with a twofold arcade.\nBackward dense branches intercept the glare\nOf afternoon with eucalyptus shade;\nEastward the level valley-plains expand,\nSweet as a queen's survey of her own Fairyland.\n\nFor through that frame the ivied arches make,\nWide tracts of sunny midland charm the eye,\nFrequent with hamlet grove, and lucent lake\nWhere the blue hills' inverted contours lie;\nFar to the east where billowy mountains break\nIn surf of snow against a sapphire sky,\nHuge thunderheads loom up behind the ranges,\nChanging from gold to pink as deepening sunset changes;\n\nAnd over plain and far sierra spread\nThe fulgent rays of fading afternoon,\nShowing each utmost peak and watershed\nAll clarified, each tassel and festoon\nOf floating cloud embroidered overhead,\nLike lotus-leaves on bluest waters strewn,\nFlushing with rose, while all breathes fresh and free\nIn peace and amplitude and bland tranquillity.\n\nDear were such evenings to this gentle pair;\nLove's tide that launched on with a blast too strong\nSweeps toward the foaming reef, the hidden snare,\nBaffling with fond illusion's siren-song,\nToo faint, on idle shoals, to linger there\nFar from Youth's glowing dream, bore them along,\nWith purple sail and steered by seraph hands\nTo isles resplendent in the sunset of romance.\n\nAnd out of this old house a flowery fane,\nA bridal bower, a pearly pleasure-dome,\nThey built, and furnished it with gold and grain,\nAnd bade all spirits of beauty hither come,\nAnd wingéd Love to enter with his train\nAnd bless their pillow, and in this his home\nMake them his priests as Hero was of yore\nIn her sweet girlhood by the blue Dardanian shore.\n\nTree-ferns, therefore, and potted palms they brought,\nTripods and urns in rare and curious taste,\nPolychrome chests and cabinets inwrought\nWith pearl and ivory etched and interlaced;\nPendant brocades with massive braid were caught,\nAnd chain-slung, oriental lamps so placed\nTo light the lounger on some low divan,\nSunken in swelling down and silks from Hindustan.\n\nAnd there was spread, upon the ample floors,\nWork of the Levantine's laborious loom,\nSuch as by Euxine or Ionian shores\nCarpets the dim seraglio's scented gloom.\nEach morn renewed, the garden's flowery stores\nBlushed in fair vases, ochre and peach-bloom,\nAnd little birds through wicker doors left wide\nFlew in to trill a space from the green world outside.\n\nAnd there was many a dainty attitude,\nBronze and eburnean. All but disarrayed,\nHere in eternal doubt sweet Psyche stood\nFain of the bath's delight, yet still afraid\nLest aught in that palatial solitude\nLurked of most menace to a helpless maid.\nTherefore forever faltering she stands,\nNor yet the last loose fold slips rippling from her hands.\n\nClose by upon a beryl column, clad\nIn the fresh flower of adolescent grace,\nThey set the dear Bithynian shepherd lad,\nThe nude Antinous. That gentle face,\nForever beautiful, forever sad,\nShows but one aspect, moon-like, to our gaze,\nYet Fancy pictures how those lips could smile\nAt revelries in Rome, and banquets on the Nile.\n\nAnd there were shapes of Beauty myriads more,\nClustering their rosy bridal bed around,\nWhose scented breadth a silken fabric wore\nBroidered with peacock hues on creamiest ground,\nFit to have graced the barge that Cydnus bore\nOr Venus' bed in her enchanted mound,\nWhile pillows swelled in stuffs of Orient dyes,\nAll broidered with strange fruits and birds of Paradise.\n\n'Twas such a bower as Youth has visions of,\nThither with one fair spirit to retire,\nLie upon rose-leaves, sleep and wake with Love\nAnd feast on kisses to the heart's desire;\nWhere by a casement opening on a grove,\nWide to the wood-winds and the sweet birds' choir,\nA girl might stand and gaze into green boughs,\nLike Credhe at the window of her golden house.\n\nOr most like Vivien, the enchanting fay,\nWhere with her friend, in the strange tower they planned,\nShe lies and dreams eternity away,\nAbove the treetops in Broceliande,\nSometimes at twilight when the woods are gray\nAnd wolf-packs howl far out across the lande,\nWaking to love, while up behind the trees\nThe large midsummer moon lifts-even so loved these.\n\nFor here, their pleasure was to come and sit\nOft when the sun sloped midway to the west,\nWatching with sweet enjoyment interknit\nThe long light slant across the green earth's breast,\nAnd clouds upon the ranges opposite,\nRolled up into a gleaming thundercrest,\nTopple and break and fall in purple rain,\nAnd mist of summer showers trail out across the plain.\n\nWhereon the shafts of ardent light, far-flung\nAcross the luminous azure overhead,\nOfttimes in arcs of transient beauty hung\nThe fragmentary rainbow's green and red.\nJoy it was here to love and to be young,\nTo watch the sun sink to his western bed,\nAnd streaming back out of their flaming core\nThe vesperal aurora's glorious banners soar.\n\nTinging each altitude of heaven in turn,\nThose fiery rays would sweep. The cumuli\nThat peeped above the mountain-tops would burn\nCarmine a space; the cirrus-whorls on high,\nMore delicate than sprays of maiden fern,\nStreak with pale rose the peacock-breasted sky,\nThen blanch. As water-lilies fold at night,\nSank back into themselves those plumes of fervid light.\n\nAnd they would watch the first faint stars appear,\nThe blue East blend with the blue hills below,\nAs lovers when their shuddering bliss draws near\nInto one pulse of fluid rapture grow.\nNew fragrance on the freshening atmosphere\nWould steal with evening, and the sunset glow\nDraw deeper down into the wondrous west\nRound vales of Proserpine and islands of the blest.\n\nSo dusk would come and mingle lake and shore,\nThe snow-peaks fade to frosty, opaline,\nTo pearl the doméd clouds the mountains bore,\nWhere late the sun's effulgent fire had been\nShowing as darkness deepened more and more\nThe incandescent lightnings flare within,\nAnd Night that furls the lily in the glen\nAnd twines impatient arms would fall, and then---and then . . .\n\nSometimes the peasant, coming late from town\nWith empty panniers on his little drove\nPast the old lookout when the Northern Crown\nGlittered with Cygnus through the scented grove,\nWould hear soft noise of lute-strings wafted down\nAnd voices singing through the leaves above\nThose songs that well from the warm heart that woos\nAt balconies in Merida or Vera Cruz.\n\nAnd he would pause under the garden wall,\nCaught in the spell of that voluptuous strain,\nWith all the sultry South in it, and all\nIts importunity of love and pain;\nAnd he would wait till the last passionate fall\nDied on the night, and all was still again.\nThen to his upland village wander home,\nMarvelling whence that flood of elfin song might come.\n\nO lyre that Love's white holy hands caress,\nYouth, from thy bosom welled their passionate lays\nSweet opportunity for happiness\nSo brief, so passing beautiful---O days,\nWhen to the heart's divine indulgences\nAll earth in smiling ministration pays\nThine was the source whose plenitude, past over,\nWhat prize shall rest to pluck, what secret to discover!\n\nThe wake of color that follows her when May\nWalks on the hills loose-haired and daisy-crowned,\nThe deep horizons of a summer's day,\nFair cities, and the pleasures that abound\nWhere music calls, and crowds in bright array\nGather by night to find and to be found;\nWhat were these worth or all delightful things\nWithout thine eyes to read their true interpretings!\n\nFor thee the mountains open glorious gates,\nTo thee white arms put out from orient skies,\nEarth, like a jewelled bride for one she waits,\nDecks but to be delicious in thine eyes,\nThou guest of honor for one day, whose fêtes\nEternity has travailed to devise;\nAh, grace them well in the brief hour they last!\nAnother's turn prepares, another follows fast.\n\nYet not without one fond memorial\nLet my sun set who found the world so fair!\nFrail verse, when Time the singer's coronal\nHas rent, and stripped the rose-leaves from his hair,\nBe thou my tablet on the temple wall!\nAmong the pious testimonials there,\nWitness how sweetly on my heart as well\nThe miracles of dawn and starry evening fell!\n\nSpeak of one then who had the lust to feel,\nAnd, from the hues that far horizons take,\nAnd cloud and sunset, drank the wild appeal,\nToo deep to live for aught but life's sweet sake,\nWhose only motive was the will to kneel\nWhere Beauty's purest benediction spake,\nWho only coveted what grove and field\nAnd sunshine and green Earth and tender arms could yield---\n\nA nympholept, through pleasant days and drear\nSeeking his faultless adolescent dream,\nA pilgrim down the paths that disappear\nIn mist and rainbows on the world's extreme,\nA helpless voyager who all too near\nThe mouth of Life's fair flower-bordered stream,\nClutched at Love's single respite in his need\nMore than the drowning swimmer clutches at a reed---\n\nThat coming one whose feet in other days\nShall bleed like mine for ever having, more\nThan any purpose, felt the need to praise\nAnd seek the angelic image to adore,\nIn love with Love, its wonderful, sweet ways\nCounting what most makes life worth living for,\nThat so some relic may be his to see\nHow I loved these things too and they were dear to me.\n\nI sometimes think a conscious happiness\nMantles through all the rose's sentient vine\nWhen summer winds with myriad calyces\nOf bloom its clambering height incarnadine;\nI sometimes think that cleaving lips, no less,\nAnd limbs that crowned desires at length entwine\nAre nerves through which that being drinks delight,\nWhose frame is the green Earth robed round with day and night.\n\nAnd such were theirs: the traveller without,\nPausing at night under the orchard trees,\nWondered and crossed himself in holy doubt,\nFor through their song and in the murmuring breeze\nIt seemed angelic choirs were all about\nMingling in universal harmonies,\nAs though, responsive to the chords they woke,\nAll Nature into sweet epithalamium broke.\n\nAnd still they think a spirit haunts the place:\n'Tis said, when Night has drawn her jewelled pall\nAnd through the branches twinkling fireflies trace\nTheir mimic constellations, if it fall\nThat one should see the moon rise through the lace\nOf blossomy boughs above the garden wall,\nThat surely would he take great ill thereof\nAnd famish in a fit of unexpressive love.\n\nBut this I know not, for what time the wain\nWas loosened and the lily's petal furled,\nThen I would rise, climb the old wall again,\nAnd pausing look forth on the sundown world,\nScan the wide reaches of the wondrous plain,\nThe hamlet sites where settling smoke lay curled,\nThe poplar-bordered roads, and far away\nFair snowpeaks colored with the sun's last ray.\n\nWaves of faint sound would pulsate from afar\nFaint song and preludes of the summer night;\nDeep in the cloudless west the evening star\nHung 'twixt the orange and the emerald light;\nFrom the dark vale where shades crepuscular\nDimmed the old grove-girt belfry glimmering white,\nThrobbing, as gentlest breezes rose or fell,\nCame the sweet invocation of the evening bell.","title":"The Deserted Garden"}],"Alexander Pope":[{"lines":"    ISAACUS NEWTONUS:\n    QUEM IMMORTALEM\nTESTANTUR

And 'tis farewell with you, my friends,\nMore dear because more near: Theokritus;\nHeine that stings and smiles; Prometheus' bard;\n(I've grown too coarse for Shelley latterly:)\nAnd one wild singer of to-day, whose song\nIs all aflame with passionate bard's blood\nLash'd into foam by pain and the world's wrong.\nAt least, he has a voice to cry his pain;\nFor him, no silent writhing in the dark,\nNo muttering of mute lips, no straining out\nOf a weak throat a-choke with pent-up sound,\nA-throb with pent-up passion. . .\nAh, my sun!\nThat's you, then, at the window, looking in\nTo beam farewell on one who's loved you long\nAnd very truly. Up, you creaking thing,\nYou squinting, cobwebbed casement!\nSo, at last,\nI can drink in the sunlight. How it falls.\nAcross that endless sea of London roofs,\nWeaving such golden wonders on the grey,\nThat almost, for the moment, we forget\nThe world of woe beneath them.\nUnderneath,\nFor all the sunset glory, Pain is king.\n\nYet, the sun's there, and very sweet withal;\nAnd I'll not grumble that it's only sun,\nBut open wide my lips--thus--drink it in;\nTurn up my face to the sweet evening sky\n(What royal wealth of scarlet on the blue\nSo tender toned, you'd almost think it green)\nAnd stretch my hands out--so--to grasp it tight.\nHa, ha! 'tis sweet awhile to cheat the Fates,\nAnd be as happy as another man.\nThe sun works in my veins like wine, like wine!\n'Tis a fair world: if dark, indeed, with woe,\nYet having hope and hint of such a joy,\nThat a man, winning, well might turn aside,\nCareless of Heaven . . .\nO enough; I turn\nFrom the sun's light, or haply I shall hope.\nI have hoped enough; I would not hope again:\n'Tis hope that is most cruel.\nTom, my friend,\nYou very sorry philosophic fool;\n'Tis you, I think, that bid me be resign'd,\nTrust, and be thankful.\nOut on you! Resign'd?\nI'm not resign'd, not patient, not school'd in\nTo take my starveling's portion and pretend\nI'm grateful for it. I want all, all, all;\nI've appetite for all. I want the best:\nLove, beauty, sunlight, nameless joy of life.\nThere's too much patience in the world, I think.\nWe have grown base with crooking of the knee.\nMankind--say--God has bidden to a feast;\nThe board is spread, and groans with cates and drinks;\nIn troop the guests; each man with appetite\nKeen-whetted with expectance.\nIn they troop,\nStruggle for seats, jostle and push and seize.\nWhat's this? what's this? There are not seats for all!\nSome men must stand without the gates; and some\nMust linger by the table, ill-supplied\nWith broken meats. One man gets meat for two,\nThe while another hungers. If I stand\nWithout the portals, seeing others eat\nWhere I had thought to satiate the pangs\nOf mine own hunger; shall I then come forth\nWhen all is done, and drink my Lord's good health\nIn my Lord's water? Shall I not rather turn\nAnd curse him, curse him for a niggard host?\nO, I have hungered, hungered, through the years,\nTill appetite grows craving, then disease;\nI am starved, wither'd, shrivelled.\nPeace, O peace!\nThis rage is idle; what avails to curse\nThe nameless forces, the vast silences\nThat work in all things.\nThis time is the third,\nI wrought before in heat, stung mad with pain,\nBlind, scarcely understanding; now I know\nWhat thing I do.\nThere was a woman once;\nDeep eyes she had, white hands, a subtle smile,\nSoft speaking tones: she did not break my heart,\nYet haply had her heart been otherwise\nMine had not now been broken. Yet, who knows?\nMy life was jarring discord from the first:\nTho' here and there brief hints of melody,\nOf melody unutterable, clove the air.\nFrom this bleak world, into the heart of night,\nThe dim, deep bosom of the universe,\nI cast myself. I only crave for rest;\nToo heavy is the load. I fling it down.\n\n\nEPILOGUE.\n\nWe knocked and knocked; at last, burst in the door,\nAnd found him as you know--the outstretched arms\nPropping the hidden face. The sun had set,\nAnd all the place was dim with lurking shade.\nThere was no written word to say farewell,\nOr make more clear the deed.\nI search'd and search'd;\nThe room held little: just a row of books\nMuch scrawl'd and noted; sketches on the wall,\nDone rough in charcoal; the old instrument\n(A violin, no Stradivarius)\nHe played so ill on; in the table drawer\nLarge schemes of undone work. Poems half-writ;\nWild drafts of symphonies; big plans of fugues;\nSome scraps of writing in a woman's hand:\nNo more--the scattered pages of a tale,\nA sorry tale that no man cared to read.\nAlas, my friend, I lov'd him well, tho' he\nHeld me a cold and stagnant-blooded fool,\nBecause I am content to watch, and wait\nWith a calm mind the issue of all things.\nCertain it is my blood's no turbid stream;\nYet, for all that, haply I understood\nMore than he ever deem'd; nor held so light\nThe poet in him. Nay, I sometimes doubt\nIf they have not, indeed, the better part--\nThese poets, who get drunk with sun, and weep\nBecause the night or a woman's face is fair.\nMeantime there is much talk about my friend.\nThe women say, of course, he died for love;\nThe men, for lack of gold, or cavilling\nOf carping critics. I, Tom Leigh, his friend\nI have no word at all to say of this.\nNay, I had deem'd him more philosopher;\nFor did he think by this one paltry deed\nTo cut the knot of circumstance, and snap\nThe chain

Song.\nLike skilful Looms which through the costly threed\nOf purling Ore, a shining wave do shed:\nSo shall the Tears we on past Grief employ,\nStill as they trickle, glitter in our Joy.\nSo with more Modesty we may be True,\nAnd speak as of the Dead the Praises due:\nWhile impious Men deceiv'd with pleasure short,\nOn their own Hopes shall find the Fall retort.\nBut the poor Beasts wanting their noble Guide,\nWhat could they move? shrunk guiltily aside.\nFirst winged Fear transports them far away,\nAnd leaden Sorrow then their flight did stay.\nSee how they each his towring Crest abate,\nAnd the green Grass, and their known Mangers hate,\nNor through wide Nostrils snuffe the wanton air,\nNor their round Hoofs, or curled Mane'scompare;\nWith wandring Eyes, and restless Ears

that Natures self were overthrown.\nIt seem'd the Earth did from the Center tear;\nIt seem'd the Sun was faln out of the Sphere:\nJustice obstructed lay, and Reason fool'd;\nCourage disheartned, and Religion cool'd.\nA dismal Silence through the Palace went,\nAnd then loud Shreeks the vaulted Marbles rent.\nSuch as the dying Chorus sings by turns,\nAnd to deaf Seas, and ruthless Tempests mourns,\nWhen now they sink, and now the plundring Streams\nBreak up each Deck, and rip the Oaken seams.\nBut thee triumphant hence the firy Carr,\nAnd firy Steeds had born out of the Warr,\nFrom the low World, and thankless Men above,\nUnto the Kingdom blest of Peace and Love:\nWe only mourn'd our selves, in thine Ascent,\nWhom thou hadst lest beneath with Mantle rent.\nFor all delight of Life thou then didst lose,\nWhen to Command, thou didst thy self Depose;\nResigning up thy Privacy so dear,\nTo turn the headstrong Peoples Charioteer;\nFor to be Cromwell was a greater thing,\nThen ought below, or yet above a King:\nTherefore thou rather didst thy Self depress,\nYielding to Rule, because it made thee Less.\nFor, neither didst thou from the first apply\nThy sober Spirit unto things too High,\nBut in thine own Fields exercisedst long,\nAn Healthful Mind within a Body strong;\nTill at the Seventh time thou in the Skyes,\nAs a small Cloud, like a Mans hand didst rise;\nThen did thick Mists and Winds the air deform,\nAnd down at last thou pow'rdst the fertile Storm;\nWhich to the thirsty Land did plenty bring,\nBut though forewarn'd, o'r-took and wet the King.\nWhat since he did, an higher Force him push'd\nStill from behind, and it before him rush'd,\nThough undiscern'd among the tumult blind,\nWho think those high Decrees by Man design'd.\n'Twas Heav'n would not that his Pow'r should cease,\nBut walk still middle betwixt War and Peace;\nChoosing each Stone, and poysing every weight,\nTrying the Measures of the Bredth and Height;\nHere pulling down, and there erecting New,\nFounding a firm State by Proportions true.\nWhen Gideon so did from the War retreat,\nYet by Conquest of two Kings grown great,\nHe on the Peace extends a Warlike power,\nAnd Is'rel silent saw him rase the Tow'r;\nAnd how he Succoths Elders durst suppress,\nWith Thorns and Briars of the Wilderness.\nNo King might ever such a Force have done;\nYet would not he be Lord, nor yet his Son.\nThou with the same strength, and an Heart as plain,\nDidst (like thine Olive) still refuse to Reign;\nThough why should others all thy Labor spoil,\nAnd Brambles be anointed with thine Oyl,\nWhose climbing Flame, without a timely stop,\nHad quickly Levell'd every Cedar's top.\nTherefore first growing to thy self a Law,\nTh'ambitious Shrubs thou in just time didst aw.\nSo have I seen at Sea, when whirling Winds,\nHurry the Bark, but more the Seamens minds,\nWho with mistaken Course salute the Sand,\nAnd threat'ning Rocks misapprehend for Land;\nWhile baleful Tritons to the shipwrack guide.\nAnd Corposants along the Tacklings slide.\nThe Passengers all wearyed out before,\nGiddy, and wishing for the fatal Shore;\nSome lusty Mate, who with more careful Eye\nCounted the Hours, and ev'ry Star did spy,\nThe Helm does from the artless Steersman strain,\nAnd doubles back unto the safer Main.\nWhat though a while they grumble discontent,\nSaving himself he does their loss prevent.\n'Tis not a Freedome, that where All command;\nNor Tyranny, where One does them withstand:\nBut who of both the Bounders knows to lay\nHim as their Father must the State obey.\nThou, and thine House, like Noah's Eight did rest,\nLeft by the Wars Flood on the Mountains crest:\nAnd the large Vale lay subject to thy Will,\nWhich thou but as an Husbandman would Till:\nAnd only didst for others plant the Vine\nOf Liberty, not drunken with its Wine.\nThat sober Liberty which men may have,\nThat they enjoy, but more they vainly crave:\nAnd such as to their Parents Tents do press,\nMay shew their own, not see his Nakedness.\nYet such a Chammish issue still does rage,\nThe Shame and Plague both of the Land and Age,\nWho watch'd thy halting, and thy Fall deride,\nRejoycing when thy Foot had slipt aside;\nthat their new King might the fifth Scepter shake,\nAnd make the World, by his Example, Quake:\nWhose frantique Army should they want for Men\nMight muster Heresies, so one were ten.\nWhat thy Misfortune, they the Spirit call,\nAnd their Religion only is to Fall.\nOh Mahomet! now couldst thou rise again,\nThy Falling-sickness should have made thee Reign,\nWhile Feake and Simpson would in many a Tome,\nHave writ the Comments of thy sacred Foame:\nFor soon thou mightst have past among their Rant\nWer't but for thine unmoved Tulipant;\nAs thou must needs have own'd them of thy band\nFor prophecies fit to be Alcorand.\nAccursed Locusts, whom your King does spit\nOut of the Center of th'unbottom'd Pit;\nWand'rers, Adult'rers, Lyers, Munser's rest,\nSorcerers, Atheists, Jesuites, Possest;\nYou who the Scriptures and the Laws deface\nWith the same liberty as Points and Lace;\nOh Race most hypocritically strict!\nBent to reduce us to the ancient Pict;\nWell may you act the Adam and the Eve;\nAy, and the Serpent too that did deceive.\nBut the great Captain, now the danger's ore,\nMakes you for his sake Tremble one fit more;\nAnd, to your spight, returning yet alive\nDoes with himself all that is good revive.\nSo when first Man did through the Morning new\nSee the bright Sun his shining Race pursue,\nAll day he follow'd with unwearied sight,\nPleas'd with that other World of moving Light;\nBut thought him when he miss'd his setting beams,\nSunk in the Hills, or plung'd below the Streams.\nWhile dismal blacks hung round the Universe,\nAnd Stars (like Tapers) burn'd upon his Herse:\nAnd Owls and Ravens with their screeching noyse\nDid make the Fun'rals sadder by their Joyes.\nHis weeping Eyes the doleful Vigils keep,\nNot knowing yet the Night was made for sleep:\nStill to the West, where he him lost, he turn'd,\nAnd with such accents, as Despairing, mourn'd:\nWhy did mine Eyes once see so bright a Ray;\nOr why Day last no longer than a Day?\nWhen streight the Sun behind him he descry'd,\nSmiling serenely from the further side.\nSo while our Star that gives us Light and Heat,\nSeem'd now a long and gloomy Night to threat,\nUp from the other World his Flame he darts,\nAnd Princes shining through their windows starts;\nWho their suspected Counsellors refuse,\nAnd credulous Ambassadors accuse.\n\"Is this, saith one, the Nation

strong;\nTill at the seventh time thou in the skies,\nAs a small cloud, like a man's hand, didst rise;\nThen did thick mists and winds the air deform,\nAnd down at last thou poured'st the fertile storm,\nWhich to the thirsty land did plenty bring,\nBut, though forewarned, o'ertook and wet the King.\n\nWhat since he did, an higher force him pushed\nStill from behind, and yet before him rushed,\nThough undiscerned among the tumult blind,\nWho think those high decrees by man designed.\n'Twas heaven would not that his power should cease,\nBut walk still middle betwixt war and peace:\nChoosing each stone, and poising every weight,\nTrying the measures of the breadth and height;\nHere pulling down, and there erecting new,\nFounding a firm state by proportions true.\n\nWhen Gideon so did from the war retreat,\nYet by the conquest of two kings grown great,\nHe on the peace extends a warlike power,\nAnd Israel silent saw him raze the tower;\nAnd how he Succorth's Elders durst suppress,\nWith thorns and briars of the wilderness.\nNo king might ever such a force have done;\nYet would not he be Lord, nor yet his son.\n\nThou with the same strength, and an heart as plain,\nDidst (like thine olive) still refuse to reign,\nThough why should others all thy labour spoil,\nAnd brambles be anointed with thine oil,\nWhose climbing flame, without a timely stop,\nHad quickly levelled every cedar's top?\nTherefore first growing to thyself a law,\nTh' ambitious shrubs thou in just time didst awe.\n\nSo have I seen at sea, when whirling winds,\nHurry the bark, but more the seamen's minds,\nWho with mistaken course salute the sand,\nAnd threatening rocks misapprehend for land,\nWhile baleful Tritons to the shipwreck guide,\nAnd corposants along the tackling slide,\nThe passengers all wearied out before,\nGiddy, and wishing for the fatal shore,\nSome lusty mate, who with more careful eye\nCounted the hours, and every star did spy,\nThe help does from the artless steersman strain,\nAnd doubles back unto the safer main.\nWhat though a while they grumble discontent,\nSaving himself, he does their loss prevent.\n\n'Tis not a freedom, that where all command;\nNor tyranny, where one does them withstand:\nBut who of both the bounder knows to lay\nHim as their father must the state obey.\n\nThou, and thine house (like Noah's eight) did rest,\nLeft by the wars' flood on the mountains' crest:\nAnd the large vale lay subject to thy will\nWhich thou but as an husbandman wouldst till:\nAnd only didst for others plant the vine\nOf liberty, not drunken with its wine.\n\nThat sober liberty which men may have,\nThat they enjoy, but more they vainly crave:\nAnd such as to their parents' tents do press,\nMay show their own, not see his nakedness.\n\nYet such a Chammish issue still does rage,\nThe shame and plague both of the land and age,\nWho watched thy halting, and thy fall deride,\nRejoicing when thy foot had slipped aside,\nThat their new king might the fifth sceptre shake,\nAnd make the world, by his example, quake:\nWhose frantic army should they want for men\nMight muster heresies, so one were ten.\nWhat thy misfortune, they the spirit call,\nAnd their religion only is to fall.\nOh Mahomet! now couldst thou rise again,\nThy falling-sickness should have made thee reign,\nWhile Feake and Simpson would in many a tome,\nHave writ the comments of thy sacred foam:\nFor soon thou mightst have passed among their rant\nWere't but for thine unmovиd tulipant;\nAs thou must needs have owned them of thy band\nFor prophecies fit to be Alcoraned.\n\nAccursиd locusts, whom your king does spit\nOut of the centre of the unbottomed pit;\nWanderers, adulterers, liars, Munster's rest,\nSorcerers, athiests, jesuits possessed;\nYou who the scriptures and the laws deface\nWith the same liberty as points and lace;\nOh race most hypocritically strict!\nBent to reduce us to the ancient Pict;\nWell may you act the Adam and the Eve;\nAy, and the serpent too that did deceive.\n\nBut the great captain, now the danger's o'er,\nMakes you for his sake tremble one fit more;\nAnd, to your spite, returning yet alive\nDoes with himself all that is good revive.\n\nSo when first man did through the morning new\nSee the bright sun his shining race pursue,\nAll day he followed with unwearied sight,\nPleased with that other world of moving light;\nBut thought him when he missed his setting beams,\nSunk in the hills, or plunged below the streams.\nWhile dismal blacks hung round the universe,\nAnd stars (like tapers) burned upon his hearse:\nAnd owls and ravens with their screeching noise\nDid make the funerals sadder by their joys.\nHis weeping eyes the doleful vigils keep,\nNot knowing yet the night was made for sleep;\nStill to the west, where he him lost, he turned,\nAnd with such accents as despairing mourned:\n`Why did mine eyes once see so bright a ray;\nOr why day last no longer than a day?'\nWhen straight the sun behind him he descried,\nSmiling serenely from the further side.\n\nSo while our star that gives us light and heat,\nSeemed now a long and gloomy night to threat,\nUp from the other world his flame he darts,\nAnd princes (shining through their windows) starts,\nWho their suspected counsellors refuse,\nAnd credulous ambassadors accuse.\n\n`Is this', saith one, `the nation that we read\nSpent with both wars, under a captain dead,\nYet rig a navy while we dress us late,\nAnd ere we dine, raze and rebuild their state?\nWhat oaken forests, and what golden mines!\nWhat mints of men, what union of designs!\n(Unless their ships, do, as their fowl proceed\nOf shedding leaves, that with their ocean breed).\nTheirs are not ships, but rather arks of war\nAnd beakиd promontories sailed from far;\nOf floating islands a new hatchиd nest;\nA fleet of worlds, of other worlds in quest;\nAn hideous shoal of wood-leviathans,\nArmed with three tier of brazen hurricanes,\nThat through the centre shoot their thundering side\nAnd sink the earth that does at anchor ride.\nWhat refuge to escape them can be found,\nWhose watery leaguers all the world surround?\nNeeds must we all their tributaries be,\nWhose navies hold the sluices of the sea.\nThe ocean is the fountain of command,\nBut that once took, we captives are on land.\nAnd those that have the waters for their share,\nCan quickly leave us neither earth nor air.\nYet if through these our fears could find a pass,\nThrough double oak, and lined with treble brass,\nThat one man still, although but named, alarms\nMore than all men, all navies, and all arms.\nHim, in the day, him, in late night I dread,\nAnd still his sword seems hanging o'er my head.\nThe nation had been ours, but his one soul\nMoves the great bulk, and animates the whole.\nHe secrecy with number hath enchased,\nCourage with age, maturity with haste:\nThe valiant's terror, riddle of the wise,\nAnd still his falchion all our knots unties.\nWhere did he learn those arts that cost us dear?\nWhere below earth, or where above the sphere?\nHe seems a king by long succession born,\nAnd yet the same to be a king does scorn.\nAbroad a king he seems, and something more,\nAt home a subject on the equal floor.\nO could I once him with our title see,\nSo should I hope that he might die as we.\nBut let them write is praise that love him best,\nIt grieves me sore to have thus much confessed.'\n\nPardon, great Prince, if thus their fear of spite\nMore than our love and duty do thee right.\nI yield, nor further will the prize contend,\nSo that we both alike may miss our end:\nWhile thou thy venerable head dost raise\nAs far above their malice as my praise,\nAnd as the Angel of our commonweal,\nTroubling the waters, yearly mak'st them heal.","title":"First Anniversary"},{"lines":"Within this sober Frame expect\nWork of no Forrain Architect;\nThat unto Caves the Quarries drew,\nAnd Forrests did to Pastures

Oh how sweet,\nAnd round your equal Fires do meet;\nWhose shrill report no Ear can tell,\nBut Ecchoes to the Eye and smell.\nSee how the Flow'rs, as at Parade,\nUnder their Colours stand displaid:\nEach Regiment in order grows,\nThat of the Tulip Pinke and Rose.\n\nBut when the vigilant Patroul\nOf Stars walks round about the Pole,\nTheir Leaves, that to the stalks are curl'd,\nSeem to their Staves the Ensigns furl'd.\nThen in some Flow'rs beloved Hut\nEach Bee as Sentinel is shut;\nAnd sleeps so too: but, if once stir'd,\nShe runs you through, or askes The Word.\n\nOh Thou, that dear and happy Isle\nThe Garden of the World ere while,\nThou Paradise of four Seas,\nWhich Heaven planted us to please,\nBut, to exclude the World, did guard\nWith watry if not flaming Sword;\nWhat luckless Apple did we tast,\nTo make us Mortal, and The Wast.\n\nUnhappy! shall we never more\nThat sweet Milltia restore,\nWhen Gardens only had their Towrs,\nAnd all the Garrisons were Flow'rs,\nWhen Roses only Arms might bear,\nAnd Men did rosie Garlands wear?\nTulips, in several Colours barr'd,\nWere then the Switzers of our Guard.\n\nThe Gardiner had the Souldiers place,\nAnd his more gentle Forts did trace.\nThe Nursery of all things green\nWas then the only Magazeen.\nThe Winter Quarters were the Stoves,\nWhere he the tender Plants removes.\nBut War all this doth overgrow:\nWe Ord'nance Plant and Powder sow.\n\nAnd yet their walks one on the Sod\nWho, had it pleased him and God,\nMight once have made our Gardens spring\nFresh as his own and flourishing.\nBut he preferr'd to the Cinque Ports\nThese five imaginary Forts:\nAnd, in those half-dry Trenches, spann'd\nPow'r which the Ocean might command.\n\nFor he did, with his utmost Skill,\nAmbition weed, but Conscience till.\nConscience, that Heaven-nursed Plant,\nWhich most our Earthly Gardens want.\nA prickling leaf it bears, and such\nAs that which shrinks at ev'ry touch;\nBut Flow'rs eternal, and divine,\nThat in the Crowns of Saints do shine.\n\nThe sight does from these Bastions ply,\nTh' invisible Artilery;\nAnd at proud Cawood Castle seems\nTo point the Battery of its Beams.\nAs if it quarrell'd in the Seat\nTh' Ambition of its Prelate great.\nBut ore the Meads below it plays,\nOr innocently seems to gaze.\n\nAnd now to the Abbyss I pass\nOf that unfathomable Grass,\nWhere Men like Grashoppers appear,\nBut Grashoppers are Gyants there:\nThey, in there squeking Laugh, contemn\nUs as we walk more low then them:\nAnd, from the Precipices tall\nOf the green spir's, to us do call.\n\nTo see Men through this Meadow Dive,\nWe wonder how they rise alive.\nAs, under Water, none does know\nWhether he fall through it or go.\nBut, as the Marriners that sound,\nAnd show upon their Lead the Ground,\nThey bring up Flow'rs so to be seen,\nAnd prove they've at the Bottom been.\n\nNo Scene that turns with Engines strange\nDoes oftner then these Meadows change,\nFor when the Sun the Grass hath vext,\nThe tawny Mowers enter next;\nWho seem like Israaliies to be,\nWalking on foot through a green Sea.\nTo them the Grassy Deeps divide,\nAnd crowd a Lane to either Side.\n\nWith whistling Sithe, and Elbow strong,\nThese Massacre the Grass along:\nWhile one, unknowing, carves the Rail,\nWhose yet unfeather'd Quils her fail.\nThe Edge all bloody from its Breast\nHe draws, and does his stroke detest;\nFearing the Flesh untimely mow'd\nTo him a Fate as black forebode.\n\nBut bloody Thestylis, that waites\nTo bring the mowing Camp their Cates,\nGreedy as Kites has trust it up,\nAnd forthwith means on it to sup:\nWhen on another quick She lights,\nAnd cryes, he call'd us Israelites;\nBut now, to make his saying true,\nRails rain for Quails, for Manna Dew.\n\nUnhappy Birds! what does it boot\nTo build below the Grasses Root;\nWhen Lowness is unsafe as Hight,\nAnd Chance o'retakes what scapeth spight?\nAnd now your Orphan Parents Call\nSounds your untimely Funeral.\nDeath-Trumpets creak in such a Note,\nAnd 'tis the Sourdine in their Throat.\n\nOr sooner hatch or higher build:\nThe Mower now commands the Field;\nIn whose new Traverse seemeth wrought\nA Camp of Battail newly fought:\nWhere, as the Meads with Hay, the Plain\nLyes quilted ore with Bodies slain:\nThe Women that with forks it filing,\nDo represent the Pillaging.\n\nAnd now the careless Victors play,\nDancing the Triumphs of the Hay;\nWhere every Mowers wholesome Heat\nSmells like an Alexanders Sweat.\nTheir Females fragrant as the Mead\nWhich they in Fairy Circles tread:\nWhen at their Dances End they kiss,\nTheir new-made Hay not sweeter is.\n\nWhen after this 'tis pil'd in Cocks,\nLike a calm Sea it shews the Rocks:\nWe wondring in the River near\nHow Boats among them safely steer.\nOr, like the Desert Memphis Sand,\nShort Pyramids of Hay do stand.\nAnd such the Roman Camps do rise\nIn Hills for Soldiers Obsequies.\n\nThis Scene again withdrawing brings\nA new and empty Face of things;\nA levell'd space, as smooth and plain,\nAs Clothes for Lilly strecht to stain.\nThe World when first created sure\nWas such a Table rase and pure.\nOr rather such is the Toril\nEre the Bulls enter at Madril.\n\nFor to this naked equal Flat,\nWhich Levellers take Pattern at,\nThe Villagers in common chase\nTheir Cattle, which it closer rase;\nAnd what below the Sith increast\nIs pincht yet nearer by the Breast.\nSuch, in the painted World, appear'd\nDavenant with th'Universal Heard.\n\nThey seem within the polisht Grass\nA landskip drawen in Looking-Glass.\nAnd shrunk in the huge Pasture show\nAs spots, so shap'd, on Faces do.\nSuch Fleas, ere they approach the Eye,\nIn Multiplyiug Glasses lye.\nThey feed so wide, so slowly move,\nAs Constellatious do above.\n\nThen, to conclude these pleasant Acts,\nDenton sets ope its Cataracts;\nAnd makes the Meadow truly be\n(What it but seem'd before) a Sea.\nFor, jealous of its Lords long stay,\nIt try's t'invite him thus away.\nThe River in it self is drown'd,\nAnd Isl's th' astonish Cattle round.\n\nLet others tell the Paradox,\nHow Eels now bellow in the Ox;\nHow Horses at their Tails do kick,\nTurn'd as they hang to Leeches quick;\nHow Boats can over Bridges sail;\nAnd Fishes do the Stables scale.\nHow Salmons trespassing are found;\nAnd Pikes are taken in the Pound.\n\nBut I, retiring from the Flood,\nTake Sanctuary in the Wood;\nAnd, while it lasts, my self imbark\nIn this yet green, yet growing Ark;\nWhere the first Carpenter might best\nFit Timber for his Keel have Prest.\nAnd where all Creatures might have shares,\nAlthough in Armies, not in Paires.\n\nThe double Wood of ancient Stocks\nLink'd in so thick, an Union locks,\nIt like two Pedigrees appears,\nOn one hand Fairfax, th' other Veres:\nOf whom though many fell in War,\nYet more to Heaven shooting are:\nAnd, as they Natures Cradle deckt,\nWill in green Age her Hearse expect.\n\nWhen first the Eye this Forrest sees\nIt seems indeed as Wood not Trees:\nAs if their Neighbourhood so old\nTo one great Trunk them all did mold.\nThere the huge Bulk takes place, as ment\nTo thrust up a Fifth Element;\nAnd stretches still so closely wedg'd\nAs if the Night within were hedg'd.\n\nDark all without it knits; within\nIt opens passable and thin;\nAnd in as loose an order grows,\nAs the Corinthean Porticoes.\nThe Arching Boughs unite between\nThe Columnes of the Temple green;\nAnd underneath the winged Quires\nEcho about their tuned Fires.\n\nThe Nightingale does here make choice\nTo sing the Tryals of her Voice.\nLow Shrubs she sits in, and adorns\nWith Musick high the squatted Thorns.\nBut highest Oakes stoop down to hear,\nAnd listning Elders prick the Ear.\nThe Thorn, lest it should hurt her, draws\nWithin the Skin its shrunken claws.\n\nBut I have for my Musick found\nA Sadder, yet more pleasing Sound:\nThe Stock-doves whose fair necks are grac'd\nWith Nuptial Rings their Ensigns chast;\nYet always, for some Cause unknown,\nSad pair unto the Elms they moan.\nO why should such a Couple mourn,\nThat in so equal Flames do burn!\n\nThen as I carless on the Bed\nOf gelid Straw-berryes do tread,\nAnd through the Hazles thick espy\nThe hatching Thrastles shining Eye,\nThe Heron from the Ashes top,\nThe eldest of its young lets drop,\nAs if it Stork-like did pretend\nThat Tribute to its Lord to send.\n\nBut most the Hewel's wonders are,\nWho here has the Holt-felsters care.\nHe walks still upright from the Root,\nMeas'ring the Timber with his Foot;\nAnd all the way, to keep it clean,\nDoth from the Bark the Wood-moths glean.\nHe, with his Beak, examines well\nWhich fit to stand and which to fell.\n\nThe good he numbers up, and hacks;\nAs if he mark'd them with the Ax.\nBut where he, tinkling with his Beak,\nDoes find the hollow Oak to speak,\nThat for his building he designs,\nAnd through the tainted Side he mines.\nWho could have thought the tallest Oak\nShould fall by such a feeble Strok'!\n\nNor would it, had the Tree not fed\nA Traitor-worm, within it bred.\n(As first our Flesh corrupt within\nTempts impotent and bashful Sin.\nAnd yet that Worm triumphs not long,\nBut serves to feed the Hewels young.\nWhile the Oake seems to fall content,\nViewing the Treason's Punishment.\n\nThus I, easie Philosopher,\nAmong the Birds and Trees confer:\nAnd little now to make me, wants\nOr of the Fowles, or of the Plants.\nGive me but Wings as they, and I\nStreight floting on the Air shall fly:\nOr turn me but, and you shall see\nI was but an inverted Tree.\n\nAlready I begin to call\nIn their most-learned Original:\nAnd where I Language want,my Signs\nThe Bird upon the Bough divines;\nAnd more attentive there doth sit\nThen if She were with Lime-twigs knit.\nNo Leaf does tremble in the Wind\nWhich I returning cannot find.\n\nOut of these scatter'd Sibyls Leaves\nStrange Prophecies my Phancy weaves:\nAnd in one History

safe, methinks, and strong, behind\nThese Trees have I incamp'd my Mind;\nWhere Beauty, aiming at the Heart,\nBends in some Tree its useless Dart;\nAnd where the World no certain Shot\nCan make, or me it toucheth not.\nBut I on it securely play,\nAnd gaul its Horsemen all the Day.\n\nBind me ye Woodbines in your 'twines,\nCurle me about ye gadding Vines,\nAnd Oh so close your Circles lace,\nThat I may never leave this Place:\nBut, lest your Fetters prove too weak,\nEre I your Silken Bondage break,\nDo you, O Brambles, chain me too,\nAnd courteous Briars nail me though.\n\nHere in the Morning tye my Chain,\nWhere the two Woods have made a Lane;\nWhile, like a Guard on either side,\nThe Trees before their Lord divide;\nThis, like a long and equal Thread,\nBetwixt two Labyrinths does lead.\nBut, where the Floods did lately drown,\nThere at the Ev'ning stake me down.\n\nFor now the Waves are fal'n and dry'd,\nAnd now the Meadows fresher dy'd;\nWhose Grass, with moister colour dasht,\nSeems as green Silks but newly washt.\nNo Serpent new nor Crocodile\nRemains behind our little Nile;\nUnless it self you will mistake,\nAmong these Meads the only Snake.\n\nSee in what wanton harmless folds\nIt ev'ry where the Meadow holds;\nAnd its yet muddy back doth lick,\nTill as a Chrystal Mirrour slick;\nWhere all things gaze themselves, and doubt\nIf they be in it or without.\nAnd for his shade which therein shines,\nNarcissus like, the Sun too pines.\n\nOh what a Pleasure 'tis to hedge\nMy Temples here with heavy sedge;\nAbandoning my lazy Side,\nStretcht as a Bank unto the Tide;\nOr to suspend my sliding Foot\nOn the Osiers undermined Root,\nAnd in its Branches tough to hang,\nWhile at my Lines the Fishes twang!\n\nBut now away my Hooks, my Quills,\nAnd Angles, idle Utensils.\nThe Young Maria walks to night:\nHide trifling Youth thy Pleasures slight.\n'Twere shame that such judicious Eyes\nShould with such Toyes a Man surprize;\nShe that already is the Law\nOf all her Sex, her Ages Aw.\n\nSee how loose Nature, in respect\nTo her, it self doth recollect;\nAnd every thing so whisht and fine,\nStarts forth with to its Bonne Mine.\nThe Sun himself, of Her aware,\nSeems to descend with greater Care,\nAnd lest She see him go to Bed,\nIn blushing Clouds conceales his Head.\n\nSo when the Shadows laid asleep\nFrom underneath these Banks do creep,\nAnd on the River as it flows\nWith Eben Shuts begin to close;\nThe modest Halcyon comes in sight,\nFlying betwixt the Day and Night;\nAnd such an horror calm and dumb,\nAdmiring Nature does benum.\n\nThe viscous Air, wheres'ere She fly,\nFollows and sucks her Azure dy;\nThe gellying Stream compacts below,\nIf it might fix her shadow so;\nThe Stupid Fishes hang, as plain\nAs Flies in Chrystal overt'ane,\nAnd Men the silent Scene assist,\nCharm'd with the saphir-winged Mist.\n\nMaria such, and so doth hush\nThe World, and through the Ev'ning rush.\nNo new-born Comet such a Train\nDraws through the Skie, nor Star new-slain.\nFor streight those giddy Rockets fail,\nWhich from the putrid Earth exhale,\nBut by her Flames, in Heaven try'd,\nNature is wholly Vitrifi'd.\n\n'Tis She that to these Gardens gave\nThat wondrous Beauty which they have;\nShe streightness on the Woods bestows;\nTo Her the Meadow sweetness owes;\nNothing could make the River be\nSo Chrystal-pure but only She;\nShe yet more Pure, Sweet, Streight, and Fair,\nThen Gardens, Woods, Meads, Rivers are.\n\nTherefore what first She on them spent,\nThey gratefully again present.\nThe Meadow Carpets where to tread;\nThe Garden Flow'rs to Crown Her Head;\nAnd for a Glass the limpid Brook,\nWhere She may all her Beautyes look;\nBut, since She would not have them seen,\nThe Wood about her draws a Skreen.\n\nFor She, to higher Beauties rais'd,\nDisdains to be for lesser prais'd.\nShe counts her Beauty to converse\nIn all the Languages as hers;\nNot yet in those her self imployes\nBut for the Wisdome, not the Noyse;\nNor yet that Wisdome would affect,\nBut as 'tis Heavens Dialect.\n\nBlest Nymph! that couldst so soon prevent\nThose Trains by Youth against thee meant;\nTears (watry Shot that pierce the Mind;)\nAnd Sighs (Loves Cannon charg'd with Wind;)\nTrue Praise (That breaks through all defence;)\nAnd feign'd complying Innocence;\nBut knowing where this Ambush lay,\nShe scap'd the safe, but roughest Way.\n\nThis 'tis to have been from the first\nIn a Domestick Heaven nurst,\nUnder the Discipline severe\nOf Fairfax, and the starry Vere;\nWhere not one object can come nigh\nBut pure, and spotless as the Eye;\nAnd Goodness doth it self intail\nOn Females, if there want a Male.\n\nGo now fond Sex that on your Face\nDo all your useless Study place,\nNor once at Vice your Brows dare knit\nLest the smooth Forehead wrinkled sit\nYet your own Face shall at you grin,\nThorough the Black-bag of your Skin;\nWhen knowledge only could have fill'd\nAnd Virtue all those Furows till'd.\n\nHence She with Graces more divine\nSupplies beyond her Sex the Line;\nAnd, like a sprig of Misleto,\nOn the Fairfacian Oak does grow;\nWhence, for some universal good,\nThe Priest shall cut the sacred Bud;\nWhile her glad Parents most rejoice,\nAnd make their Destiny their Choice.\n\nMean time ye Fields, Springs, Bushes, Flow'rs,\nWhere yet She leads her studious Hours,\n(Till Fate her worthily translates,\nAnd find a Fairfax for our Thwaites)\nEmploy the means you have by Her,\nAnd in your kind your selves preferr;\nThat, as all Virgins She preceds,\nSo you all Woods, Streams, Gardens, Meads.\n\nFor you Thessalian Tempe's Seat\nShall now be scorn'd as obsolete;\nAranjeuz, as less, disdain'd;\nThe Bel-Retiro as constrain'd;\nBut name not the Idalian Grove,\nFor 'twas the Seat of wanton Love;\nMuch less the Dead's Elysian Fields,\nYet nor to them your Beauty yields.\n\n'Tis not, what once it was, the World;\nBut a rude heap together hurl'd;\nAll negligently overthrown,\nGulfes, Deserts, Precipices, Stone.\nYour lesser World contains the same.\nBut in more decent Order tame;\nYou Heaven's Center, Nature's Lap.\nAnd Paradice's only Map.\n\nBut now the

Death of His Late Highness the Lord Protector\n\nThat Providence which had so long the care\nOf Cromwell's head, and numbered every hair,\nNow in itself (the glass where all appears)\nHad seen the period of his golden years:\nAnd thenceforh only did attend to trace\nWhat death might least so fair a life deface.\n\nThe people, which what most they fear esteem,\nDeath when more horrid, so more noble deem,\nAnd blame the last act, like spectators vain,\nUnless the prince whom they applaud be slain.\nNor fate indeed can well refuse that right\nTo those that lived in war, to die in fight.\n\nBut long his valour none had left that could\nEndanger him, or clemency that would.\nAnd he whom Nature all for peace had made,\nBut angry heaven unto war had swayed,\nAnd so less useful where he most desired,\nFor what he least affected was admired,\nDeservиd yet an end whose every part,\nShould speak the wondrous softness of his heart.\n\nTo Love and Grief the fatal writ was 'signed;\n(Those nobler weaknesses of human kind,\nFrom which those powers that issued the decree,\nAlthough immortal, found they were not free),\nThat they, to whom his breast still open lies,\nIn gentle passions should his death disguise:\nAnd leave succeeding ages cause to mourn,\nAs long as Grief shall weep, or Love shall burn.\n\nStraight does a slow and languishing disease\nEliza, Nature's and his darling, seize.\nHer when an infant, taken with her charms,\nHe oft would flourish in his mighty arms,\nAnd, lest their force the tender burden wrong,\nSlacken the vigour of his muscles strong;\nThen to the Mother's breast her softly move,\nWhich while she drained of milk, she filled with love.\nBut as with riper years her virtue grew,\nAnd every minute adds a lustre new,\nWhen with meridian height her beauty shined,\nAnd thorough that sparkled her fairer mind,\nWhen she with smiles serene in words discreet\nHis hidden soul at ever turn could meet;\nThen might y'ha' daily his affection spied,\nDoubling that knot which destiny had tied,\nWhile they by sense, not knowing, comprehend\nHow on each other both their fates depend.\nWith her each day the pleasing hours he shares,\nAnd at her aspect calms his growing cares;\nOr with a grandsire's joy her children sees\nHanging about her neck or at his knees.\nHold fast, dear infants, hold them both or none;\nThis will not stay when once the other's gone.\n\nA silent fire now wastes those limbs of wax,\nAnd him within his tortured image racks.\nSo the flower withering which the garden crowned,\nThe sad root pines in secret under ground.\nEach groan he doubled and each sigh he sighed,\nRepeated over to the restless night.\nNo trembling string composed to numbers new,\nAnswers the touch in notes more sad, more true.\nShe, lest he grieve, hides what she can her pains,\nAnd he to lessen hers his sorrow feigns:\nYet both perceived, yet both concealed their skills,\nAnd so diminishing increased their ills:\nThat whether by each other's grief they fell,\nOr on their own redoubled, none can tell.\n\nAnd now Eliza's purple locks were shorn,\nWhere she so long her Father's fate had worn:\nAnd frequent lightning to her soul that flies,\nDivides the air, and opens all the skies:\nAnd now his life, suspended by her breath,\nRan out impetuously to hasting death.\nLike polished mirrors, so his steely breast\nHad every figure of her woes expressed,\nAnd with the damp of her last gasp obscured,\nHad drawn such stains as were not to be cured.\nFate could not either reach with single stroke,\nBut the dear image fled, the mirror broke.\n\nWho now shall tell us more of mournful swans,\nOf halcyons kind, or bleeding pelicans?\nNo downy breast did e'er so gently beat,\nOr fan with airy plumes so soft an heat.\nFor he no duty by his height excused,\nNor, though a prince, to be a man refused:\nBut rather than in his Eliza's pain\nNot love, not grieve, would neither live nor reign:\nAnd in himself so oft immortal tried,\nYet in compassion of another died.\n\nSo have I seen a vine, whose lasting age\nOf many a winter hath survived the rage,\nUnder whose shady tent men every year\nAt its rich blood's expense their sorrow cheer,\nIf some dear branch where it extends its life\nChance to be pruned by an untimely knife,\nThe parent-tree unto the grief succeeds,\nAnd through the wound its vital humour bleeds,\nTrickling in watery drops, whose flowing shape\nWeeps that it falls ere fixed into a grape.\nSo the dry stock, no more that spreading vine,\nFrustrates the autumn and the hopes of wine.\n\nA secret cause does sure those signs ordain\nForeboding princes' falls, and seldom vain.\nWhether some kinder powers that wish us well,\nWhat they above cannot prevent foretell;\nOr the great world do by consent presage,\nAs hollow seas with future tempests rage;\nOr rather heaven, which us so long foresees,\nTheir funerals celebrates while it decrees.\nBut never yet was any human fate\nBy Nature solemnized with so much state.\nHe unconcerned the dreadful passage crossed;\nBut, oh, what pangs that death did Nature cost!\n\nFirst the great thunder was shot off, and sent\nThe signal from the starry battlement.\nThe winds receive it, and its force outdo,\nAs practising how they could thunder too;\nOut of the binder's hand the sheaves they tore,\nAnd thrashed the harvest in the airy floor;\nOr of huge trees, whose growth with his did rise,\nThe deep foundations opened to the skies.\nThen heavy show'rs the wingиd tempests lead,\nAnd pour the deluge o'er the chaos' head.\nThe race of warlike horses at his tomb\nOffer themselves in many a hecatomb;\nWith pensive head towards the ground they fall,\nAnd helpless languish at the tainted stall.\nNumbers of men decrease with pains unknown,\nAnd hasten, not to see his death, their own.\nSuch tortures all the elements unfixed,\nTroubled to part where so exactly mixed.\nAnd as through air his wasting spirits flowed,\nThe universe laboured beneath their load.\n\nNature, it seemed with him would Nature vie;\nHe with Eliza. It with him would die,\nHe without noise still travelled to his end,\nAs silent suns to meet the night descend.\nThe stars that for him fought had only power\nLeft to determine now his final hour,\nWhich, since they might not hinder, yet they cast\nTo choose it worthy of his glories past.\n\nNo part of time but bare his mark away\nOf honour; all the year was Cromwell's day:\nBut this, of all the most ausicious found,\nTwice had in open field him victor crowned:\nWhen up the armиd mountains of Dunbar\nHe marched, and through deep Severn ending war.\nWhat day should him eternize but the same\nThat had before immortalized his name?\nThat so who ere would at his death have joyed,\nIn their own griefs might find themselves employed;\nBut those that sadly his departure grieved,\nYet joyed, remebering what he once achieved.\nAnd the last minute his victorious ghost\nGave chase to Ligny on the Belgic coast.\nHere ended all his mortal toils: he laid\nAnd slept in place under the laurel shade.\n\nO Cromwell, Heaven's Favourite! To none\nHave such high honours from above been shown:\nFor whom the elements we mourners see,\nAnd heaven itself would the great herald be,\nWhich with more care set forth his obsequies\nThan those of Moses hid from human eyes,\nAs jealous only here lest all be less,\nThat we could to his memory express.\nThen let us to our course of mourning keep:\nWhere heaven leads, 'tis piety to weep.\nStand back, ye seas, and shrunk beneath the veil\nOf your abyss, with covered head bewail\nYour Monarch: we demand not your supplies\nTo compass in our isle; our tears suffice:\nSince him away the dismal tempest rent,\nWho once more joined us to the continent;\nWho planted England on the Flandric shore,\nAnd stretched our frontier to the Indian ore;\nWhose greater truths obscure the fables old,\nWhether of British saints or Worthies told;\nAnd in a valour lessening Arthur's deeds,\nFor holiness the Confessor exceeds.\n\nHe first put arms into Religion's hand,\nAnd timorous Conscience unto Courage manned:\nThe soldier taught that inward mail to wear,\nAnd fearing God how they should nothing fear.\n`Those strokes,' he said, `will pierce through all below\nWhere those that strike from heaven fetch their blow.'\nAstonished armies did their flight prepare,\nAnd cities strong were stormиd by his prayer;\nOf that, forever Preston's field shall tell\nThe story, and impregnable Clonmel.\nAnd where the sandy mountain Fenwick scaled,\nThe sea between, yet hence his prayer prevailed.\nWhat man was ever so in heaven obeyed\nSince the commanded sun o'er Gideon stayed?\nIn all his wars needs must he triumph when\nHe conquered God still ere he fought with men:\n\nHence, though in battle none so brave or fierce,\nYet him the adverse steel could never pierce.\nPity it seemed to hurt him more that felt\nEach wound himself which he to others dealt;\nDanger itself refusing to offend\nSo loose an enemy, so fast a friend.\n\nFriendship, that sacred virtue, long does claim\nThe first foundation of his house and name:\nBut within one its narrow limits fall,\nHis tenderness extended unto all.\nAnd that deep soul through every channel flows,\nWhere kindly nature loves itself to lose.\nMore strong affections never reason served,\nYet still affected most what best deserved.\nIf he Eliza loved to that degree,\n(Though who more worthy to be loved than she?)\nIf so indulgent to his own, how dear\nTo him the children of the highest were?\nFor her he once did nature's tribute pay:\nFor these his life adventured every day:\nAnd 'twould be found, could we his thoughts have cast,\nTheir griefs struck deepest, if Eliza's last.\n\nWhat prudence more than human did he need\nTo keep so dear, so differing minds agreed?\nThe worser sort, as conscious of their ill,\nLie weak and easy to the ruler's will;\nBut to the good (too many or too few)\nAll law is useless, all reward is due.\nOh ill-advised, if not for love, for shame,\nSpare yet your own, if you neglect his fame;\nLest others dare to think your zeal a mask,\nAnd you to govern, only heaven's task.\n\nValour, religion, friendship, prudence died\nAt once with him, and all that's good beside;\nAnd we death's refuse, nature's dregs, confined\nTo loathsome life, alas! are left behind.\nWhere we (so once we used) shall now no more\nTo fetch the day, press about his chamber door--\nFrom which he issued with that awful state,\nIt seemd Mars broke through Janus' double gate,\nYet always tempered with an air so mild,\nNo April suns that e'er so gently smiled--\nNo more shall hear that powerful language charm,\nWhose force oft spared the labour of his arm:\nNo more shall follow where he spent the days\nIn war, in counsel, or in prayer and praise,\nWhose meanest acts he would himself advance,\nAs ungirt David to the ark did dance.\nAll, all is gone of our or his delight\nIn horses fierce, wild deer, or armour bright;\nFrancisca fair can nothing now but weep,\nNor with soft notes shall sing his cares asleep.\n\nI saw him dead.

sometimes in disgrace,\n5.26 Sometime an abject, then again in place:\n5.27 Such private changes oft mine eyes have seen.\n5.28 In various times of state I've also been.\n5.29 I've seen a Kingdom

Holland sav'd, Calais won,\n5.34 And Philip and Albertus half undone.\n5.35 I saw all peace at home, terror to foes,\n5.36 But ah, I saw at last those eyes to close,\n5.37 And then, me thought, the world at noon grew dark\n5.38 When it had lost that radiant Sun-like spark.\n5.39 In midst of griefs, I saw some hopes revive\n5.40 (For 'twas our hopes then kept our hearts alive);\n5.41 I saw hopes dash't, our forwardness was shent,\n5.42 And silenc'd we, by Act of Parliament.\n5.43 I've seen from Rome, an execrable thing,\n5.44 A plot to blow up Nobles and their King.\n5.45 I've seen designs at Ree and Cades cross't,\n5.46 And poor Palatinate for every lost.\n5.47 I've seen a Prince to live on others' lands,\n5.48 A Royal one, by alms from Subjects' hands.\n5.49 I've seen base men, advanc'd to great degree,\n5.50 And worthy ones, put to extremity,\n5.51 But not their Prince's love, nor state so high,\n5.52 Could once reverse, their shameful destiny.\n5.53 I've seen one stabb'd, another lose his head,\n5.54 And others fly their Country through their dread.\n5.55 I've seen, and so have ye, for 'tis but late,\n5.56 The desolation of a goodly State.\n5.57 Plotted and acted so that none can tell\n5.58 Who gave the counsell, but the Prince of hell.\n5.59 I've seen a land unmoulded with great pain,\n5.60 But yet may live to see't made up again.\n5.61 I've seen it shaken, rent, and soak'd in blood,\n5.62 But out of troubles ye may see much good.\n5.63 These are no old wives' tales, but this is truth.\n5.64 We old men love to tell, what's done in youth.\n5.65 But I return from whence I stept awry;\n5.66 My memory is short and brain is dry.\n5.67 My Almond-tree (gray hairs) doth flourish now,\n5.68 And back, once straight, begins apace to bow.\n5.69 My grinders now are few, my sight doth fail,\n5.70 My skin is wrinkled, and my cheeks are pale.\n5.71 No more rejoice, at music's pleasant noise,\n5.72 But do awake at the cock's clanging voice.\n5.73 I cannot scent savours of pleasant meat,\n5.74 Nor sapors find in what I drink or eat.\n5.75 My hands and arms, once strong, have lost their might.\n5.76 I cannot labour, nor I cannot fight:\n5.77 My comely legs, as nimble as the Roe,\n5.78 Now stiff and numb, can hardly creep or go.\n5.79 My heart sometimes as fierce, as Lion bold,\n5.80 Now trembling, and fearful, sad, and cold.\n5.81 My golden Bowl and silver Cord,

pleases, whilst it pains,\nLike penetrating Notes of sad Harmonious Strains.\nSelected Friendships timely he began,\nAnd siezed in Youth that best Delight of Man,\nLeaving a growing Race to mourn his End,\nTheir earliest and their Ages promis'd Friend.\nBut far away alas! that Prospect moves,\nLost in the Clouds, like distant Hills and Groves,\nWhilst with encreasing Steps we all pursue\nWhat Time

But eminence\nOf misery is thine, as once of joy;\nAnd, as we view the strange vicissitude,\nWe ask anew, where happiness is found?------\nAlas! in rural life, where youthful dreams\nSee the Arcadia that Romance describes,\nNot even Content resides!--In yon low hut\nOf clay and thatch, where rises the grey smoke\nOf smold'ring turf, cut from the adjoining moor,\nThe labourer, its inhabitant, who toils\nFrom the first dawn of twilight, till the Sun\nSinks in the rosy waters of the West,\nFinds that with poverty it cannot dwell;\nFor bread, and scanty bread, is all he earns\nFor him and for his household--Should Disease,\nBorn of chill wintry rains, arrest his arm,\nThen, thro' his patch'd and straw-stuff'd casement, peeps\nThe squalid figure of extremest Want;\nAnd from the Parish the reluctant dole,\nDealt by th' unfeeling farmer, hardly saves\nThe ling'ring spark of life from cold extinction:\nThen the bright Sun of Spring, that smiling bids\nAll other animals rejoice, beholds,\nCrept from his pallet, the emaciate wretch\nAttempt, with feeble effort, to resume\nSome heavy task, above his wasted strength,\nTurning his wistful looks (how much in vain!)\nTo the deserted mansion, where no more\nThe owner (gone to gayer scenes) resides,\nWho made even luxury, Virtue; while he gave\nThe scatter'd crumbs to honest Poverty.--\nBut, tho' the landscape be too oft deform'd\nBy figures such as these, yet Peace is here,\nAnd o'er our vallies, cloath'd with springing corn,\nNo hostile hoof shall trample, nor fierce flames\nWither the wood's young verdure, ere it form\nGradual the laughing May's luxuriant shade;\nFor, by the rude sea guarded, we are safe,\nAnd feel not evils such as with deep sighs\nThe Emigrants deplore, as, they recal\nThe Summer past, when Nature seem'd to lose\nHer course in wild distemperature, and aid,\nWith seasons all revers'd, destructive War.\nShuddering, I view the pictures they have drawn\nOf desolated countries, where the ground,\nStripp'd of its unripe produce, was thick strewn\nWith various Death--the war-horse falling there\nBy famine, and his rider by the sword.\nThe moping clouds sail'd heavy charg'd with rain,\nAnd bursting o'er the mountains misty brow,\nDeluged, as with an inland sea, the vales 5 ;\nWhere, thro' the sullen evening's lurid gloom,\nRising, like columns of volcanic fire,\nThe flames of burning villages illum'd\nThe waste of water; and the wind, that howl'd\nAlong its troubled surface, brought the groans\nOf plunder'd peasants, and the frantic shrieks\nOf mothers for their children; while the brave,\nTo pity still alive, listen'd aghast\nTo these dire echoes, hopeless to prevent\nThe evils they beheld, or check the rage,\nWhich ever, as the people of one land\nMeet in contention, fires the human heart\nWith savage thirst of kindred blood, and makes\nMan lose his nature; rendering him more fierce\nThan the gaunt monsters of the howling waste.\nOft have I heard the melancholy tale,\nWhich, all their native gaiety forgot,\nThese Exiles tell--How Hope impell'd them on,\nReckless of tempest, hunger, or the sword,\nTill order'd to retreat, they knew not why,\nFrom all their flattering prospects, they became\nThe prey of dark suspicion and regret 6 :\nThen, in despondence, sunk the unnerv'd arm\nOf gallant Loyalty--At every turn\nShame and disgrace appear'd, and seem'd to mock\nTheir scatter'd squadrons; which the warlike youth,\nUnable to endure, often implor'd,\nAs the last act of friendship, from the hand\nOf some brave comrade, to receive the blow\nThat freed the indignant spirit from its pain.\nTo a wild mountain, whose bare summit hides\nIts broken eminence in clouds; whose steeps\nAre dark with woods; where the receding rocks\nAre worn by torrents of dissolving snow,\nA wretched Woman, pale and breathless, flies!\nAnd, gazing round her, listens to the sound\nOf hostile footsteps---- No! it dies away:\nNor noise remains, but of the cataract,\nOr surly breeze of night, that mutters low\nAmong the thickets, where she trembling seeks\nA temporary shelter--clasping close\nTo her hard-heaving heart, her sleeping child,\nAll she could rescue of the innocent groupe\nThat yesterday surrounded her--Escap'd\nAlmost by miracle! Fear, frantic Fear,\nWing'd her weak feet: yet, half repentant now\nHer headlong haste, she wishes she had staid\nTo die with those affrighted Fancy paints\nThe lawless soldier's victims--Hark! again\nThe driving tempest bears the cry of Death,\nAnd, with deep sudden thunder, the dread sound\nOf cannon vibrates on the tremulous earth;\nWhile, bursting in the air, the murderous bomb\nGlares o'er her mansion. Where the splinters fall,\nLike scatter'd comets, its destructive path\nIs mark'd by wreaths of flame!--Then, overwhelm'd\nBeneath accumulated horror, sinks\nThe desolate mourner; yet, in Death itself,\nTrue to maternal tenderness, she tries\nTo save the unconscious infant from the storm\nIn which she perishes; and to protect\nThis last dear object of her ruin'd hopes\nFrom prowling monsters, that from other hills,\nMore inaccessible, and wilder wastes,\nLur'd by the scent of slaughter, follow fierce\nContending hosts, and to polluted fields\nAdd dire increase of horrors--But alas!\nThe Mother and the Infant perish both!--\nThe feudal Chief, whose Gothic battlements\nFrown on the plain beneath, returning home\nFrom distant lands, alone and in disguise,\nGains at the fall of night his Castle walls,\nBut, at the vacant gate, no Porter sits\nTo wait his Lord's admittance!--In the courts\nAll is drear silence!--Guessing but too well\nThe fatal truth, he shudders as he goes\nThro' the mute hall; where, by the blunted light\nThat the dim moon thro' painted casements lends,\nHe sees that devastation has been there:\nThen, while each hideous image to his mind\nRises terrific, o'er a bleeding corse\nStumbling he falls; another interrupts\nHis staggering feet--all, all who us'd to rush\nWith joy to meet him--all his family\nLie murder'd in his way!--And the day dawns\nOn a wild raving Maniac, whom a fate\nSo sudden and calamitous has robb'd\nOf reason; and who round his vacant walls\nScreams unregarded, and reproaches Heaven!--\nSuch are thy dreadful trophies, savage War!\nAnd evils such as these, or yet more dire,\nWhich the pain'd mind recoils from, all are thine--\nThe purple Pestilence, that to the grave\nSends whom the sword has spar'd, is thine; and thine\nThe Widow's anguish and the Orphan's tears!--\nWoes such as these does Man inflict on Man;\nAnd by the closet murderers, whom we style\nWise Politicians; are the schemes prepar'd,\nWhich, to keep Europe's wavering balance even,\nDepopulate her kingdoms, and consign\nTo tears and anguish half a bleeding world!--\nOh! could the time return, when thoughts like these\nSpoil'd not that gay delight, which vernal Suns,\nIlluminating hills, and woods, and fields,\nGave to my infant spirits--Memory come!\nAnd from distracting cares, that now deprive\nSuch scenes of all their beauty, kindly bear\nMy fancy to those hours of simple joy,\nWhen, on the banks of Arun, which I see\nMake its irriguous course thro' yonder meads,\nI play'd; unconscious then of future ill!\nThere (where, from hollows fring'd with yellow broom,\nThe birch with silver rind, and fairy leaf,\nAslant the low stream trembles) I have stood,\nAnd meditated how to venture best\nInto the shallow current, to procure\nThe willow herb of glowing purple spikes,\nOr flags, whose sword-like leaves conceal'd the tide,\nStartling the timid reed-bird from her nest,\nAs with aquatic flowers I wove the wreath,\nSuch as, collected by the shepherd girls,\nDeck in the villages the turfy shrine,\nAnd mark the arrival of propitious May.--\nHow little dream'd I then the time would come,\nWhen the bright Sun of that delicious month\nShould, from disturb'd and artificial sleep,\nAwaken me to never-ending toil,\nTo terror and to tears!--Attempting still,\nWith feeble hands and cold desponding heart,\nTo save my children from the o'erwhelming wrongs,\nThat have for ten long years been heap'd on me!--\nThe fearful spectres of chicane and fraud\nHave, Proteus like, still chang'd their hideous forms\n(As the Law lent its plausible disguise),\nPursuing my faint steps; and I have seen\nFriendship's sweet bonds (which were so early form'd,)\nAnd once I fondly thought of amaranth\nInwove with silver seven times tried) give way,\nAnd fail; as these green fan-like leaves of fern\nWill wither at the touch of Autumn's frost.\nYet there are those , whose patient pity still\nHears my long murmurs; who, unwearied, try\nWith lenient hands to bind up every wound\nMy wearied spirit feels, and bid me go\n\"Right onward 7 \"--a calm votary of the Nymph,\nWho, from her adamantine rock, points out\nTo conscious rectitude the rugged path,\nThat leads at length to Peace!--Ah!

Allan Poe":[{"lines":"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door.\n\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--\n        Only this and nothing more.\"\n\nAh, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\n        Nameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--\n    This it is and nothing more.\"\n\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door:--\n      Darkness there and nothing more.\n\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,\n  fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"\n      Merely this and nothing more.\n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.\n\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--\nLet my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;--\n    'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"\n\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--\n    Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no\n  craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n      With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\n\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--\nTill I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before--\nOn the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"\n      Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"\n\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--\nTill the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore\n    Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"\n\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and\n  door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n    Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\n\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,\nBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,\n      _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath\n  sent thee\nRespite--respite aad nepenthé from thy memories of Lenore!\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthé, and forget this lost Lenore!\"\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--\nOn this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--\nIs there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"\n    Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked,\n  upstarting--\n\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\n    Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\n    Shall be lifted--nevermore!","title":"The Raven"},{"lines":"Hear the sledges with

with its duplicate horn.\n\nAnd I said--\"She is warmer than Dian:\n  She rolls through an ether of sighs--\n  She revels in a region of sighs:\nShe has seen that the tears are not dry on\n  These

on us with her bright eyes--\nCome up through the lair of the Lion,\n  With love in her luminous eyes.\"\n\nBut Psyche, uplifting her finger,\n  Said--\"Sadly this star I mistrust--\n  Her pallor I strangely mistrust:--\nOh, hasten!--oh, let us not linger!\n  Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.\"\nIn terror she spoke, letting sink her\n  Wings till they trailed in the dust--\nIn agony sobbed, letting sink her\n  Plumes till they trailed in the dust--\n  Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.\n\nI replied--\"This is nothing but dreaming:\n  Let us on by this tremulous light!\n  Let us bathe in this crystalline light!\nIts Sibyllic splendor is beaming\n  With Hope and in Beauty to-night:--\n  See!--it flickers up the sky through the night!\nAh, we safely may trust to its gleaming,\n  And be sure it will lead us aright--\nWe safely may trust to a gleaming\n  That cannot but guide us aright,\n  Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.\"\n\nThus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,\n  And tempted her out of her gloom--\n  And conquered her scruples and gloom;\nAnd we passed to the end of a vista,\n  But were stopped by the door of a tomb--\n  By the door of a legended tomb;\nAnd I said--\"What is written, sweet sister,\n  On the door of this legended tomb?\"\n  She replied--\"Ulalume--Ulalume--\n  'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!\"\n\nThen my heart it grew ashen and sober\n  As the leaves that were crisped and sere--\n  As the leaves that were withering and sere;\nAnd I cried--\"It was surely October\n  On _this_ very night of last year\n  That I journeyed--I

for love is not so light\nAs straight to burn at first beholder's sight.\n\nBut they, which love indeed, look otherwise,\nWith pure regard and spotless true intent,\nDrawing out of the object of their eyes\nA more refined form, which they present\nUnto their mind, void of all blemishment;\nWhich it reducing to her first perfection,\nBeholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.\n\nAnd then conforming it unto the light,\nWhich in itself it hath remaining still,\nOf that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,\nThereof he fashions in his higher skill\nAn heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;\nAnd it embracing in his mind entire,\nThe mirror of his own thought doth admire.\n\nWhich seeing now so inly fair to be,\nAs outward it appeareth to the eye,\nAnd with his spirit's proportion to agree,\nHe thereon fixeth all his fantasy,\nAnd fully setteth his felicity;\nCounting it fairer than it is indeed,\nAnd yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.\n\nFor lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be\nThan other men's, and in dear love's delight\nSee more than any other eyes can see,\nThrough mutual receipt of beam{\"e}s bright,\nWhich carry privy message to the spright,\nAnd to their eyes that inmost fair display,\nAs plain as light discovers dawning day.\n\nTherein they see, through amorous eye-glances,\nArmies of loves still flying to and fro,\nWhich dart at them their little fiery lances;\nWhom having wounded, back again they go,\nCarrying compassion to their lovely foe;\nWho, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,\nCures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.\n\nIn which how many wonders do they rede\nTo their conceit, that others never see,\nNow of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,\nLike gods with nectar in their banquets free;\nNow of her looks, which like to cordials be;\nBut when her words' embássade forth she sends,\nLord, how sweet music that unto them lends.\n\nSometimes upon her forehead they behold\nA thousand graces masking in delight;\nSometimes within her eyelids they unfold\nTen thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight\nDo seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;\nBut on her lips, like rosy buds in May,\nSo many millions of chaste pleasures play.\n\nAll those, O Cytherea, and thousands more\nThy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,\nTo deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,\nThat may it more to mortal eyes commend,\nAnd make it more admir'd of foe and friend:\nThat in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,\nAnd spread thy lovely kingdom over all.\n\nThen Iö, triumph!

rest with him around;\nSo those likewise do by degrees redound,\nAnd rise more fair; till they at last arrive\nTo the most fair, whereto they all do strive.\n\nFair is the heaven where happy souls have place,\nIn full enjoyment of felicity,\nWhence they do still behold the glorious face\nOf the divine eternal Majesty;\nMore fair is that, where those Ideas on high\nEnranged be, which Plato so admired,\nAnd pure Intelligences from God inspired.\n\nYet fairer is that heaven, in which do reign\nThe sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates,\nWhich in their high protections do contain\nAll mortal princes and imperial states;\nAnd fairer yet, whereas the royal Seats\nAnd heavenly Dominations are set,\nFrom whom all earthly governance is fet.\n\nYet far more fair be those bright Cherubins,\nWhich all with golden wings are overdight,\nAnd those eternal burning Seraphins,\nWhich from their faces dart out fiery light;\nYet fairer than they both, and much more bright,\nBe th' Angels and Archangels, which attend\nOn God's own person, without rest or end.\n\nThese thus in fair each other far excelling,\nAs to the highest they approach more near,\nYet is that highest far beyond all telling,\nFairer than all the rest which there appear,\nThough all their beauties join'd together were;\nHow then can mortal tongue hope to express\nThe image of such endless perfectness?\n\nCease then, my tongue, and lend unto my mind\nLeave to bethink how great that beauty is,\nWhose utmost parts so beautiful I find;\nHow much more those essential parts of his,\nHis truth, his love, his wisdom, and his bliss,\nHis grace, his doom, his mercy, and his might,\nBy which he lends us of himself a sight.\n\nThose unto all he daily doth display,\nAnd shew himself in th' image of his grace,\nAs in a looking-glass, through which he may\nBe seen of all his creatures vile and base,\nThat are unable else to see his face,\nHis glorious face which glistereth else so bright,\nThat th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.\n\nBut we, frail wights, whose sight cannot sustain\nThe sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine,\nBut that their points rebutted back again\nAre dull'd, how can we see with feeble eyne\nThe glory of that Majesty Divine,\nIn sight of whom both sun and moon are dark,\nCompared to his least resplendent spark?\n\nThe means, therefore, which unto us is lent\nHim to behold, is on his works to look,\nWhich he hath made in beauty excellent,\nAnd in the same, as in a brazen book,\nTo read enregister'd in every nook\nHis goodness, which his beauty doth declare;\nFor all that's good is beautiful and fair.\n\nThence gathering plumes of perfect speculation,\nTo imp the wings of thy high-flying mind,\nMount up aloft through heavenly contemplation,\nFrom this dark world, whose damps the soul so blind,\nAnd, like the native brood of eagles' kind,\nOn that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes,\nClear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.\n\nHumbled with fear and awful reverence,\nBefore the footstool of his majesty\nThrow thyself down, with trembling innocence,\nNe dare look up with corruptible eye\nOn the dread face of that great Deity,\nFor fear, lest if he chance to look on thee,\nThou turn to nought, and quite confounded be.\n\nBut lowly fall before his mercy seat,\nClose covered with the Lamb's integrity\nFrom the just wrath of his avengeful threat\nThat sits upon the righteous throne on high;\nHis throne is built upon eternity,\nMore firm and durable than steel or brass,\nOr the hard diamond, which them both doth pass.\n\nHis sceptre is the rod of righteousness,\nWith which he bruiseth all his foes to dust,\nAnd the great Dragon strongly doth repress,\nUnder the rigour of his judgement just;\nHis seat is truth, to which the faithful trust,\nFrom whence proceed her beams so pure and bright\nThat all about him sheddeth glorious light:\n\nLight far exceeding that bright blazing spark\nWhich darted is from Titan's flaming head,\nThat with his beams enlumineth the dark\nAnd dampish air, whereby all things are read;\nWhose nature yet so much is marvelled\nOf mortal wits, that it doth much amaze\nThe greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.\n\nBut that immortal light, which there doth shine,\nIs many thousand times more bright, more clear,\nMore excellent, more glorious, more divine,\nThrough which to God all mortal actions here,\nAnd even the thoughts of men, do plain appear;\nFor from th' eternal truth it doth proceed,\nThrough heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.\n\nWith the great glory of that wondrous light\nHis throne is all encompassed around,\nAnd hid in his own brightness from the sight\nOf all that look thereon with eyes unsound;\nAnd underneath his feet are to be found\nThunder and lightning and tempestuous fire,\nThe instruments of his avenging ire.\n\nThere in his bosom Sapience doth sit,\nThe sovereign darling of the Deity,\nClad like a queen in royal robes, most fit\nFor so great power and peerless majesty,\nAnd all with gems and jewels gorgeously\nAdorn'd, that brighter than the stars appear,\nAnd make her native brightness seem more clear.\n\nAnd on her head a crown of purest gold\nIs set, in sign of highest sovereignty;\nAnd in her hand a sceptre she doth hold,\nWith which she rules the house of God on high,\nAnd manageth the ever-moving sky,\nAnd in the same these lower creatures all\nSubjected to her power imperial.\n\nBoth heaven and earth obey unto her will,\nAnd all the creatures which they both contain;\nFor of her fullness which the world doth fill\nThey all partake, and do in state remain\nAs their great Maker did at first ordain,\nThrough observation of her high behest,\nBy which they first were made, and still increast.\n\nThe fairness of her face no tongue can tell;\nFor she the daughters of all women's race,\nAnd angels eke, in beauty doth excel,\nSparkled on her from God's own glorious face,\nAnd more increas'd by her own goodly grace,\nThat it doth far exceed all human thought,\nNe can on earth compared be to aught.\n\nNe could that painter (had he lived yet)\nWhich pictured Venus with so curious quill,\nThat all posterity admired it,\nHave portray'd this, for all his mast'ring skill;\nNe she herself, had she remained still,\nAnd were as fair as fabling wits do feign,\nCould once come near this beauty sovereign.\n\nBut had those wits, the wonders of their days,\nOr that sweet Teian poet, which did spend\nHis plenteous vein in setting forth her praise,\nSeen but a glimpse of this which I pretend,\nHow wondrously would he her face commend,\nAbove that idol of his feigning thought,\nThat all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.\n\nHow then dare I, the novice of his art,\nPresume to picture so divine a wight,\nOr hope t' express her least perfection's part,\nWhose beauty fills the heavens with her light,\nAnd darks the earth with shadow of her sight?\nAh, gentle Muse, thou art too weak and faint\nThe portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.\n\nLet angels, which her goodly face behold\nAnd see at will, her sovereign praises sing,\nAnd those most sacred mysteries unfold\nOf that fair love of mighty heaven's King;\nEnough is me t' admire so heavenly thing,\nAnd being thus with her huge love possest,\nIn th' only wonder of herself to rest.\n\nBut whoso may, thrice happy man him hold,\nOf all on earth whom God so much doth grace\nAnd lets his own beloved to behold;\nFor in the view of her celestial face\nAll joy, all bliss, all happiness, have place;\nNe aught on earth can want unto the wight\nWho of herself can win the wishful sight.\n\nFor she, out of her secret treasury,\nPlenty of riches forth on him will pour,\nEven heavenly riches, which there hidden lie\nWithin the closet of her chastest bower,\nTh' eternal portion of her precious dower,\nWhich mighty God hath given to her free,\nAnd to all those which thereof worthy be.\n\nNone thereof worthy be, but those whom she\nVouchsafeth to her presence to receive,\nAnd letteth them her lovely face to see,\nWhereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive,\nAnd sweet contentment, that it doth bereave\nTheir soul of sense, through infinite delight,\nAnd them transport from flesh into the spright.\n\nIn which they see such admirable things,\nAs carries them into an ecstasy,\nAnd hear such heavenly notes, and carollings\nOf God's high praise, that fills the brazen sky;\nAnd feel such joy and pleasure inwardly,\nThat maketh them all worldly cares forget,\nAnd only think on that before them set.\n\nNe from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense,\nOr idle thought of earthly things, remain;\nBut all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence,\nAnd all that pleased erst now seems to pain;\nTheir joy, their comfort, their desire, their gain,\nIs fixed all on that which now they see;\nAll other sights but feigned shadows be.\n\nAnd that fair lamp, which useth to inflame\nThe hearts of men with self-consuming fire\nThenceforth seems foul, and full of sinful blame;\nAnd all that pomp to which proud minds aspire\nBy name of honour, and so much desire,\nSeems to them baseness, and all riches dross,\nAnd all mirth sadness, and all lucre loss.\n\nSo full their eyes are of that glorious sight,\nAnd senses fraught with such satiety,\nThat in nought else on earth they can delight,\nBut in th' aspect of that felicity,\nWhich they have written in their inward eye;\nOn which they feed, and in their fastened mind\nAll happy joy and full contentment find.\n\nAh, then, my hungry soul, which long hast fed\nOn idle fancies of thy foolish thought,\nAnd, with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled,\nHast after vain deceitful shadows sought,\nWhich all are fled, and now have left thee nought\nBut late repentance through thy follies prief;\nAh cease to gaze on matter of thy grief:\n\nAnd look at last up to that sovereign light,\nFrom whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs,\nThat kindleth love in every godly sprite,\nEven the love of God, which loathing brings\nOf this vile world and these gay-seeming things;\nWith whose sweet pleasures being so possest,\nThy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest.","title":"An Hymn Of Heavenly Beauty"},{"lines":"YE learned sisters, which have oftentimes\nBeene to me ayding, others to adorne,\nWhom ye thought worthy of

staine;\nAnd the sweet pleasures of theyr loves delight\nWith secret ayde doest succour and supply,\nTill they bring forth the fruitfull progeny;\nSend us the timely fruit of this same night.\nAnd thou, fayre Hebe! and thou, Hymen free!\nGrant that it may so be.\nTil which we cease your further prayse to sing;\nNe any woods shall answer, nor your Eccho ring.\n\nAnd ye high heavens, the temple of the gods,\nIn which a thousand torches flaming bright\nDoe burne, that to us wretched earthly clods\nIn dreadful darknesse lend desired light\nAnd all ye powers which in the same remayne,\nMore then we men can fayne!\nPoure out your blessing on us plentiously,\nAnd happy influence upon us raine,\nThat we may raise a large posterity,\nWhich from the earth, which they may long possesse\nWith lasting happinesse,\nUp to your haughty pallaces may mount;\nAnd, for the guerdon of theyr glorious merit,\nMay heavenly tabernacles there inherit,\nOf blessed Saints for to increase the count.\nSo let us rest, sweet love, in hope of this,\nAnd cease till then our tymely joyes to sing:\nThe woods no more us answer, nor our eccho ring!\n\nSong! made in lieu of many ornaments,\nWith which my love

so I learn to fly,\nThat flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath,\nTill she herself for stronger flight can breathe.\n\nThen look, who list thy gazeful eyes to feed\nWith sight of that is fair, look on the frame\nOf this wide universe, and therein reed\nThe endless kinds of creatures which by name\nThou canst not count, much less their natures aim;\nAll which are made with wondrous wise respect,\nAnd all with admirable beauty deckt.\n\nFirst th' earth, on adamantine pillars founded,\nAmid the sea engirt with brazen bands;\nThen th' air still flitting, but yet firmly bounded\nOn every side, with piles of flaming brands,\nNever consum'd, nor quench'd with mortal hands;\nAnd last, that mighty shining crystal wall,\nWherewith he hath encompassed this All.\n\nBy view whereof it plainly may appear,\nThat still as every thing doth upward tend,\nAnd further is from earth, so still more clear\nAnd fair it grows, till to his perfect end\nOf purest beauty it at last ascend;\nAir more than water, fire much more than air,\nAnd heaven than fire, appears more pure and fair.\n\nLook thou no further, but affix thine eye\nOn that bright, shiny, round, still moving mass,\nThe house of blessed gods, which men call sky,\nAll sow'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass,\nWhereof each other doth in brightness pass,\nBut those two most, which ruling night and day,\nAs king and queen, the heavens' empire sway;\n\nAnd tell me then, what hast thou ever seen\nThat to their beauty may compared be,\nOr can the sight that is most sharp and keen\nEndure their captain's flaming head to see?\nHow much less those, much higher in degree,\nAnd so much fairer, and much more than these,\nAs these are fairer than the land and seas?\n\nFor far above these heavens, which here we see,\nBe others far exceeding these in light,\nNot bounded, not corrupt, as these same be,\nBut infinite in largeness and in height,\nUnmoving, uncorrupt, and spotless bright,\nThat need no sun t' illuminate their spheres,\nBut their own native light far passing theirs.\n\nAnd as these heavens still by degrees arise,\nUntil they come to their first Mover's bound,\nThat in his mighty compass doth comprise,\nAnd carry all the rest with him around;\nSo those likewise do by degrees redound,\nAnd rise more fair; till they at last arrive\nTo the most fair, whereto they all do strive.\n\nFair is the heaven where happy souls have place,\nIn full enjoyment of felicity,\nWhence they do still behold the glorious face\nOf the divine eternal Majesty;\nMore fair is that, where those Ideas on high\nEnranged be, which Plato so admired,\nAnd pure Intelligences from God inspired.\n\nYet fairer is that heaven, in which do reign\nThe sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates,\nWhich in their high protections do contain\nAll mortal princes and imperial states;\nAnd fairer yet, whereas the royal Seats\nAnd heavenly Dominations are set,\nFrom whom all earthly governance is fet.\n\nYet far more fair be those bright Cherubins,\nWhich all with golden wings are overdight,\nAnd those eternal burning Seraphins,\nWhich from their faces dart out fiery light;\nYet fairer than they both, and much more bright,\nBe th' Angels and Archangels, which attend\nOn God's own person, without rest or end.\n\nThese thus in fair each other far excelling,\nAs to the highest they approach more near,\nYet is that highest far beyond all telling,\nFairer than all the rest which there appear,\nThough all their beauties join'd together were;\nHow then can mortal tongue hope to express\nThe image of such endless perfectness?\n\nCease then, my tongue, and lend unto my mind\nLeave to bethink how great that beauty is,\nWhose utmost parts so beautiful I find;\nHow much more those essential parts of his,\nHis truth, his love, his wisdom, and his bliss,\nHis grace, his doom, his mercy, and his might,\nBy which he lends us of himself a sight.\n\nThose unto all he daily doth display,\nAnd shew himself in th' image of his grace,\nAs in a looking-glass, through which he may\nBe seen of all his creatures vile and base,\nThat are unable else to see his face,\nHis glorious face which glistereth else so bright,\nThat th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.\n\nBut we, frail wights, whose sight cannot sustain\nThe sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine,\nBut that their points rebutted back again\nAre dull'd, how can we see with feeble eyne\nThe glory of that Majesty Divine,\nIn sight of whom both sun and moon are dark,\nCompared to his least resplendent spark?\n\nThe means, therefore, which unto us is lent\nHim to behold, is on his works to look,\nWhich he hath made in beauty excellent,\nAnd in the same, as in a brazen book,\nTo read enregister'd in every nook\nHis goodness, which his beauty doth declare;\nFor all that's good is beautiful and fair.\n\nThence gathering plumes of perfect speculation,\nTo imp the wings of thy high-flying mind,\nMount up aloft through heavenly contemplation,\nFrom this dark world, whose damps the soul so blind,\nAnd, like the native brood of eagles' kind,\nOn that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes,\nClear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.\n\nHumbled with fear and awful reverence,\nBefore the footstool of his majesty\nThrow thyself down, with trembling innocence,\nNe dare look up with corruptible eye\nOn the dread face of that great Deity,\nFor fear, lest if he chance to look on thee,\nThou turn to nought, and quite confounded be.\n\nBut lowly fall before his mercy seat,\nClose covered with the Lamb's integrity\nFrom the just wrath of his avengeful threat\nThat sits upon the righteous throne on high;\nHis throne is built upon eternity,\nMore firm and durable than steel or brass,\nOr the hard diamond, which them both doth pass.\n\nHis sceptre is the rod of righteousness,\nWith which he bruiseth all his foes to dust,\nAnd the great Dragon strongly doth repress,\nUnder the rigour of his judgement just;\nHis seat is truth, to which the faithful trust,\nFrom whence proceed her beams so pure and bright\nThat all about him sheddeth glorious light:\n\nLight far exceeding that bright blazing spark\nWhich darted is from Titan's flaming head,\nThat with his beams enlumineth the dark\nAnd dampish air, whereby all things are read;\nWhose nature yet so much is marvelled\nOf mortal wits, that it doth much amaze\nThe greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.\n\nBut that immortal light, which there doth shine,\nIs many thousand times more bright, more clear,\nMore excellent, more glorious, more divine,\nThrough which to God all mortal actions here,\nAnd even the thoughts of men, do plain appear;\nFor from th' eternal truth it doth proceed,\nThrough heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.\n\nWith the great glory of that wondrous light\nHis throne is all encompassed around,\nAnd hid in his own brightness from the sight\nOf all that look thereon with eyes unsound;\nAnd underneath his feet are to be found\nThunder and lightning and tempestuous fire,\nThe instruments of his avenging ire.\n\nThere in his bosom Sapience doth sit,\nThe sovereign darling of the Deity,\nClad like a queen in royal robes, most fit\nFor so great power and peerless majesty,\nAnd all with gems and jewels gorgeously\nAdorn'd, that brighter than the stars appear,\nAnd make her native brightness seem more clear.\n\nAnd on her head a crown of purest gold\nIs set, in sign of highest sovereignty;\nAnd in her hand a sceptre she doth hold,\nWith which she rules the house of God on high,\nAnd manageth the ever-moving sky,\nAnd in the same these lower creatures all\nSubjected to her power imperial.\n\nBoth heaven and earth obey unto her will,\nAnd all the creatures which they both contain;\nFor of her fullness which the world doth fill\nThey all partake, and do in state remain\nAs their great Maker did at first ordain,\nThrough observation of her high behest,\nBy which they first were made, and still increast.\n\nThe fairness of her face no tongue can tell;\nFor she the daughters of all women's race,\nAnd angels eke, in beauty doth excel,\nSparkled on her from God's own glorious face,\nAnd more increas'd by her own goodly grace,\nThat it doth far exceed all human thought,\nNe can on earth compared be to aught.\n\nNe could that painter (had he lived yet)\nWhich pictured Venus with so curious quill,\nThat all posterity admired it,\nHave portray'd this, for all his mast'ring skill;\nNe she herself, had she remained still,\nAnd were as fair as fabling wits do feign,\nCould once come near this beauty sovereign.\n\nBut had those wits, the wonders of their days,\nOr that sweet Teian poet, which did spend\nHis plenteous vein in setting forth her praise,\nSeen but a glimpse of this which I pretend,\nHow wondrously would he her face commend,\nAbove that idol of his feigning thought,\nThat all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.\n\nHow then dare I, the novice of his art,\nPresume to picture so divine a wight,\nOr hope t' express her least perfection's part,\nWhose beauty fills the heavens with her light,\nAnd darks the earth with shadow of her sight?\nAh, gentle Muse, thou art too weak and faint\nThe portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.\n\nLet angels, which her goodly face behold\nAnd see at will, her sovereign praises sing,\nAnd those most sacred mysteries unfold\nOf that fair love of mighty heaven's King;\nEnough is me t' admire so heavenly thing,\nAnd being thus with her huge love possest,\nIn th' only wonder of herself to rest.\n\nBut whoso may, thrice happy man him hold,\nOf all on earth whom God so much doth grace\nAnd lets his own beloved to behold;\nFor in the view of her celestial face\nAll joy, all bliss, all happiness, have place;\nNe aught on earth can want unto the wight\nWho of herself can win the wishful sight.\n\nFor she, out of her secret treasury,\nPlenty of riches forth on him will pour,\nEven heavenly riches, which there hidden lie\nWithin the closet of her chastest bower,\nTh' eternal portion of her precious dower,\nWhich mighty God hath given to her free,\nAnd to all those which thereof worthy be.\n\nNone thereof worthy be, but those whom she\nVouchsafeth to her presence to receive,\nAnd letteth them her lovely face to see,\nWhereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive,\nAnd sweet contentment, that it doth bereave\nTheir soul of sense, through infinite delight,\nAnd them transport from flesh into the spright.\n\nIn which they see such admirable things,\nAs carries them into an ecstasy,\nAnd hear such heavenly notes, and carollings\nOf God's high praise, that fills the brazen sky;\nAnd feel such joy and pleasure inwardly,\nThat maketh them all worldly cares forget,\nAnd only think on that before them set.\n\nNe from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense,\nOr idle thought of earthly things, remain;\nBut all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence,\nAnd all that pleased erst now seems to pain;\nTheir joy, their comfort, their desire, their gain,\nIs fixed all on that which now they see;\nAll other sights but feigned shadows be.\n\nAnd that fair lamp, which useth to inflame\nThe hearts of men with self-consuming fire\nThenceforth seems foul, and full of sinful blame;\nAnd all that pomp to which proud minds aspire\nBy name of honour, and so much desire,\nSeems to them baseness, and all riches dross,\nAnd all mirth sadness, and all lucre loss.\n\nSo full their eyes are of that glorious sight,\nAnd senses fraught with such satiety,\nThat in nought else on earth they can delight,\nBut in th' aspect of that felicity,\nWhich they have written in their inward eye;\nOn which they feed, and in their fastened mind\nAll happy joy and full contentment find.\n\nAh, then, my hungry soul, which long hast fed\nOn idle fancies of thy foolish thought,\nAnd, with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled,\nHast after vain deceitful shadows sought,\nWhich all are fled, and now have left thee nought\nBut late repentance through thy follies prief;\nAh cease to gaze on matter of thy grief:\n\nAnd look at last up to that sovereign light,\nFrom whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs,\nThat kindleth love in every godly sprite,\nEven the love of God, which loathing brings\nOf this vile world and these gay-seeming things;\nWith whose sweet pleasures being so possest,\nThy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest.","title":"A Hymn Of Heavenly Beauty"},{"lines":"1\n\nYe heavenly spirits, whose ashy cinders lie\nUnder deep ruins, with huge walls

sharpèd steeples high shot up in air;\nGreece will the old Ephesian buildings blaze;\nAnd Nylus' nurslings their Pyramids fair;\nThe same yet vaunting Greece will tell the story\nOf Jove's great image in Olympus placed,\nMausolus' work will be the Carian's glory,\nAnd Crete will boast the Labybrinth, now 'rased;\nThe antique Rhodian will likewise set forth\nThe great Colosse, erect to Memory;\nAnd what else in the world is of like worth,\nSome greater learnèd wit will magnify.\nBut I will sing above all monuments\nSeven Roman Hills, the world's seven wonderments.\n\n\n3\n\nThou stranger, which for Rome in Rome here seekest,\nAnd nought of Rome in Rome perceiv'st at all,\nThese same old walls, old arches, which thou seest,\nOld Palaces, is that which Rome men call.\nBehold what wreak, what ruin, and what waste,\nAnd how that she, which with her mighty power\nTam'd all the world, hath tam'd herself at last,\nThe prey of time, which all things doth devour.\nRome now of Rome is th' only funeral,\nAnd only Rome of Rome hath victory;\nNe ought save Tyber hastening to his fall\nRemains of all: O world's inconstancy.\nThat which is firm doth flit and fall away,\nAnd that is flitting, doth abide and stay.\n\n\n4\n\nShe, whose high top above the stars did soar,\nOne foot on Thetis, th' other on the Morning,\nOne hand on Scythia, th' other on the Moor,\nBoth heaven and earth in roundness compassing,\nJove fearing, lest if she should greater grow,\nThe old Giants should once again uprise,\nHer whelm'd with hills, these seven hills, which be now\nTombs of her greatness, which did threat the skies:\nUpon her head he heaped Mount Saturnal,\nUpon her belly th' antique Palatine,\nUpon her stomach laid Mount Quirinal,\nOn her left hand the noisome Esquiline,\nAnd Cælian on the right; but both her feet\nMount Viminall and Aventine do meet.\n\n\n5\n\nWho lists to see, what ever nature, art,\nAnd heaven could do, O Rome, thee let him see,\nIn case thy greatness he can guess in heart,\nBy that which but the picture is of thee.\nRome is no more: but if the shade of Rome\nMay of the body yield a seeming sight,\nIt's like a corse drawn forth out of the tomb\nBy Magick skill out of eternal night:\nThe corpse of Rome in ashes is entombed,\nAnd her great sprite rejoinèd to the sprite\nOf this great mass, is in the same enwombed;\nBut her brave writings, which her famous merit\nIn spite of time, out of the dust doth rear,\nDo make her idol through the world appear.\n\n\n6\n\nSuch as the Berecynthian Goddess bright\nIn her swift chariot with high turrets crowned,\nProud that so many Gods she brought to light;\nSuch was this City in her good days found:\nThis city, more than the great Phrygian mother\nRenowned for fruit of famous progeny,\nWhose greatness by the greatness of none other,\nBut by herself her equal match could see:\nRome only might to Rome comparèd be,\nAnd only Rome could make great Rome to tremble:\nSo did the Gods by heavenly doom decree,\nThat other deathly power should not resemble\nHer that did match the whole earth's puissaunce,\nAnd did her courage to the heavens advance.\n\n\n7\n\nYe sacred ruins, and ye tragic sights,\nWhich only do the name of Rome retain,\nOld monuments, which of so famous sprites\nThe honour yet in ashes do maintain:\nTriumphant arcs, spires neighbors to the sky,\nThat you to see doth th' heaven itself appall,\nAlas, by little ye to nothing fly,\nThe people's fable, and the spoil of all:\nAnd though your frames do for a time make war\n'Gainst time, yet time in time shall ruinate\nYour works and names, and your last relics mar.\nMy sad desires, rest therefore moderate:\nFor if that time make ends of things so sure,\nIt also will end the pain, which I endure.\n\n\n8\n\nThrough arms and vassals Rome the world subdued,\nThat one would ween, that one sole City's strength\nBoth land and sea in roundess had surview'd,\nTo be the measure of her breadth and length:\nThis people's virtue yet so fruitful was\nOf virtuous nephews that posterity\nStriving in power their grandfathers to pass,\nThe lowest earth join'd to the heaven high;\nTo th' end that having all parts in their power\nNought from the Roman Empire might be 'quite,\nAnd that though time doth Commonwealths devour,\nYet no time should so low embase their height,\nThat her head earth'd in her foundations deep,\nShould not her name and endless honour keep.\n\n\n9\n\nYe cruel stars, and eke ye Gods unkind,\nHeaven envious, and bitter stepdame Nature,\nBe it by fortune, or by course of kind\nThat ye do weld th' affairs of earthly creature:\nWhy have your hands long sithence troubled\nTo frame this world, that doth endure so long?\nOr why were not these Roman palaces\nMade of some matter no less firm and strong?\nI say not, as the common voice doth say,\nThat all things which beneath the moon have being\nAre temporal, and subject to decay:\nBut I say rather, though not all agreeing\nWith some, that ween the contrary in thought:\nThat all this whole shall one day come to nought.\n\n\n10\n\nAs that brave son of Aeson, which by charms\nAchieved the golden fleece in Colchid land,\nOut of the earth engendered men of arms\nOf Dragons' teetch, sown in the sacred sand;\nSo this brave town, that in her youthly days\nAn Hydra was of warriors glorious,\nDid fill with her renownéd nurslings praise\nThe firey sun's both one and other house:\nBut they at last, there being then not living\nAn Hercules, so rank seed to repress,;\nAmongst themselves with cruel fury striving,\nMow'd down themselves with slaughter merciless;\nRenewing in themselves that rage unkind,\nWhich whilom did those searthborn brethren blind.\n\n\n11\n\nMars shaming to have given so great head\nTo his off-spring, that mortal puissance\nPuffed up with pride of Roman hardy head,\nSeem'd above heaven's power itself to advance;\nCooling again his former kindled heat,\nWith which he had those Roman spirits filled;\nDid blow new fire, and with enflaméd breath,\nInto the Gothic cold hot rage instill'd:\nThen 'gan that Nation, th' earth's new Giant brood,\nTo dart abroad the thunder bolts of war,\nAnd beating down these walls with furious mood\nInto her mother's bosom, all did mar;\nTo th' end that none, all were if Jove his sire\nShould boast himself of the Roman Empire.\n\n\n12\n\nLike as whilome the children of the earth\nHeaped hills on hills, to scale the starry sky,\nAnd fight against the Gods of heavenly birth,\nWhilst Jove at them his thunderbolts let fly;\nAll suddenly with lightning overthrown,\nThe furious squadrons down the ground did fall,\nThat th' earth under her children's weight did groan,\nAnd th' heavens in glory triumphed over all:\nSo did that haughty front which heapéd was\nOn these seven Roman hills, itself uprear\nOver the world, and lift her lofty face\nAgainst the heaven, that 'gan her force to fear.\nBut now these scorned fields bemoan her fall,\nAnd Gods secure fear not her force at all.\n\n\n13\n\nNor the swift fury of the flames aspiring,\nNor the deep wounds of victor's raging blade,\nNor ruthless spoil of soldiers blood-desiring,\nThe which so oft thee, Rome, their conquest made;\nNe stroke on stroke of fortune variable,\nNe rust of age hating continuance,\nNor wrath of Gods, nor spite of men unstable,\nNor thou oppos'd against thine own puissance;\nNor th' horrible uproar of winds high blowing,\nNor swelling streams of that God snaky-paced,\nWhich hath so often with his overflowing\nThee drenched, have thy pride so much abased;\nBut that this nothing, which they have thee left,\nMakes the world wonder, what they from thee reft.\n\n\n14\n\nAs men in summer fearless pass the ford,\nWhich is in winter lord of all the plain,\nAnd with his tumbling streams doth bear aboard\nThe plowman's hope, and shepherd's labor vain;\nAnd as the coward beasts use to despise\nThe noble lion after his life's end\nWhetting their teeth, and with vain foolhardise\nDaring the foe, that cannot him defend:\nAnd as at Troy most dastards of the Greeks\nDid brave about the corpse of Hector cold;\nSo those which whilome wont with pallid cheeks\nThe Roman triumphs glory to behold,\nNow on these ashy tombs show boldness vain,\nAnd conquer'd dare the Conqueror disdain.\n\n\n15\n\nYe pallid spirits, and ye ashy ghosts,\nWhich joying in the brightness of your day,\nBrought forth those signs of your premptuous boasts\nWhich now their dusty relics do bewray;\nTell me ye spirits (sith the darksome river\nOf Styx not passable to souls returning,\nEnclosing you in thrice three wards forever,\nDo not restrain your images still mourning)\nTell me then (for perhaps some one of you\nYet here above him secretly doth hide)\nDo ye not feel your torments to accrue,\nWhen ye sometimes behold the ruin'd pride\nOf these old Roman works built with your hands,\nNow to become nought else, but heaped sands?\n\n\n16\n\nLike as ye see the wrathful sea from far,\nIn a great mountain heap'd with hideous noise,\nEftsoons of thousand bilows shouldered narre,\nAgainst a rock to break with dreadful poise;\nLike as ye see fell Boreas with sharp blast,\nTossing huge tempests through the troubled sky,\nEftsoons having his wide wings spent in vast,\nTo stop his wearie carrier suddenly;\nAnd as ye see huge flames spread diversly,\nGathered in one up to the heavens to spire,\nEftsoons consum'd to fall down feebily:\nSo whilom did this Monarchy aspire\nAs waves, as wind, as fire spread over all,\nTill it by fatal doom adown did fall.\n\n\n17\n\nSo long as Jove's great bird did make his flight,\nBearing the fire with which heaven doth us fray,\nHeaven had not fear of that presumptuous might,\nWith which the Giants did the Gods assay.\nBut all so soon, as scorching Sun had brent\nHis wings, which wont to the earth to overspread,\nThe earth out of her massy womb forth sent\nThat antique horror, which made heaven adread.\nThen was the German raven in disguise\nThat Roman eagle seen to cleave asunder,\nAnd towards heaven freshly to arise\nOut of these mountains, not consum'd to powder.\nIn which the fowl that serves to bear the lightning,\nIs now no more seen flying, nor alighting.\n\n\n18\n\nThese heaps of stones, these old walls which ye see,\nWere first enclosures but of savage soil;\nAnd these brave palaces which mastered be\nOf time, were shepherds cottages somewhile.\nThen took the shepherd kingly ornamnets\nAnd the stout hynde arm'd his right hand with steel:\nEftsoones their rule of yearly presidents\nGrew great, and six months greater a great deal;\nWhich made perpetual, rose to so great might,\nThat thence th' imperial Eagle rooting took,\nTill th' heaven itself opposing 'gainst her might,\nHer power to Peter's successor betook;\nWho shepherdlike, (as fates the same forseeing)\nDoth show, that all things turn to their first being.\n\n\n19\n\nAll that is perfect, which th' heaven beautifies;\nAll that's imperfect, born below the moon;\nAll that doth feed our spriits and our eyes;\nAnd all that doth consume our pleasures soon;\nAll the mishap, the which our days outwears,\nAll the good hap of th' oldest times afore,\nRome in the time of her great ancesters,\nLike a Pandora, locked long in store.\nBut destiny this huge Chaos turmoiling,\nIn which all good and evil was enclosed,\nTheir heavenly virtues from these woes absolving,\nCarried to heaven, from sinful bondage loosed:\nBut their great sins, the causers of their pain,\nUnder these antique ruins yet remain.\n\n\n20\n\nNo otherwise than rainy cloud, first fed\nWith earthly vapors gathered in the air,\nEftsoones in compass arch'd, to steep his head,\nDoth plunge himself in Tethys' bosom fair;\nAnd mounting up again, from whence he came,\nWith his great belly spreads the dimmed world,\nTill at last the last dissolving his moist frame,\nIn rain, or snow, or hail he forth is hurl'd;\nThis City, which was first but shepherds' shade,\nUprising by degrees, grew to such height,\nThat queen of land and sea herself she made.\nAt last not able to bear so great weight.\nHer power dispers'd, through all the world did vade;\nTo show that all in th' end to nought shall fade.\n\n\n21\n\nThe same which Pyrrhus, and the puissance\nOf Afric could not tame, that same brave city,\nWhich with stout courage arm'd against mischance,\nSustain'd the shock of common enmity;\nLong as her ship tossed with so many freaks,\nHad all the world in arms against her bent,\nWas never seen, that any fortune's wreaks\nCould break her course begun with brave intent.\nBut when the object of her virtue failed,\nHer power itself agains itself did arm;\nAs he that having long in tempest sailed,\nFain would arrive, but cannot for the storm,\nIf too great wind against the port him drive,\nDoth in the port itself his vessel rive.\n\n\n22\n\nWhen that brave honour of the Latin name,\nWhich bound her rule with Africa, and Byze,\nWith Thames' inhabitants of noble fame,\nAnd they which see the dawning day arise;\nHer nurslings did with mutinous uproar\nHearten against herself, her conquer'd spoil,\nWhich she had won from all the world afore,\nOf all the world was spoil'd within a while.\nSo when the compass'd course of the universe\nIn six and thirty thousand years is run,\nThe bands of th' elements shall back reverse\nTo their first discord, and be quite undone:\nThe seeds, of which all things at first were bred,\nShall in great Chaos' womb again be hid.\n\n\n23\n\nO wary wisdom of the man, that would\nThat Carthage towers from spoil should be forborn,\nTo th' end that his victorious people should\nWith cankering leisure not be overworn;\nHe well foresaw, how that the Roman courage,\nImpatient of pleasure's faint desires,\nThrough idleness would turn to civil rage,\nAnd be herself the matter of her fires.\nFor in a people given all to ease,\nAmbition is engend'red easily;\nAs in a vicious body, gross disease\nSoon grows through humours' superfluity.\nThat came to pass, when swoll'n with plentious pride,\nNor prince, nor peer, nor kin they would abide.\n\n\n24\n\nIf the blind fury, which wars breedeth oft,\nWonts not t' enrage the hearts of equal beasts,\nWhether they fare on foot, or fly aloft,\nOr arméd be with claws, or scaly crests;\nWhat fell Erynnis with hot burning tongs,\nDid grip your hearts, with noisome rage imbew'd,\nThat each to other working cruel wrongs,\nYou blades in your own bowels you embrew'd?\nWas this (ye Romans) your hard destiny?\nOr some old sin, whose unappeased guilt\nPower'd vengeance forth on you eternally?\nOr brother's blood, the which at first was spilt\nUpon your walls, that God might not endure,\nUpon the same to set foundation sure?\n\n\n25\n\nO that I had the Thracian Poet's harp,\nFor to awake out of th' infernal shade\nThose antique Cæsars, sleeping long in dark,\nThe which this ancient City whilome made:\nOr that I had Amphion's instrument,\nTo quicken with his vital note's accord,\nThe stony joints of these old walls now rent,\nBy which th' Ausonian light might be restor'd:\nOr that at least I could with pencil fine,\nFashion the portraits of these palaces,\nBy pattern of great Virgil's spirit divine;\nI would assay with that which in me is,\nTo build with level of my lofty style,\nThat which no hands can evermore compile.\n\n\n26\n\nWho list the Roman greatness forth to figure,\nHim needeth not to seek for usage right\nOf line, or lead, or rule, or square, to measure\nHer length, her breadth, her deepness, or her height:\nBut him behooves to view in compass round\nAll that the ocean grasps in his long arms;\nBe it where the yearly star doth scorch the ground,\nOr where cold Boreas blows his bitter storms.\nRome was th' whole world, and all the world was Rome,\nAnd if things nam'd their names do equalize,\nWhen land and sea ye name, then name ye Rome;\nAnd naming Rome ye land and sea comprise:\nFor th' ancient plot of Rome displayéd plain,\nThe map of all the wide world doth contain.\n\n\n27\n\nThou that at Rome astonish'd dost behold\nThe antique pride, which menaced the sky,\nThese haughty heaps, these palaces of old,\nThese walls, these arcs, these baths, these temples hie;\nJudge by these ample ruins' view, the rest\nThe which injurious time hath quite outworne,\nSince of all workmen held in reck'ning best,\nYet these old fragments are for patterns born:\nThen also mark, how Rome from day to day,\nRepairing her decayéd fashion,\nRenews herself with buildings rich and gay;\nThat one would judge, that the Roman dæmon\nDoth yet himself with fatal hand enforce,\nAgain on foot to rear her pouldred corse.\n\n\n28\n\nHe

She had lived\nA sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage,\nAccounting that to leap from perch to perch\nWas act and joy enough for any bird.\nDear heaven, how silly are the things that live\nIn thickets, and eat berries !\nI, alas,\nA wild bird scarcely fledged, was brought to her cage,\nAnd she was there to meet me. Very kind.\nBring the clean water, give out the fresh seed.\nShe stood upon the steps to welcome me,\nCalm, in black garb. I clung about her neck, --\nYoung babes, who catch at every shred of wool\nTo draw the new light closer, catch and cling\nLess blindly. In my ears, my father's word\nHummed ignorantly, as the sea in shells,\n`Love, love, my child.' She, black there with my grief,\nMight feel my love -- she was his sister once,\nI clung to her. A moment, she seemed moved,\nKissed me with cold lips, suffered me to cling,\nAnd drew me feebly through the hall into\nThe room she sate in.\nThere, with some strange spasm\nOf pain and passion, she wrung loose my hands\nImperiously, and held me at arm's length,\nAnd with two grey-steel naked-bladed eyes\nSearched through my face, -- ay, stabbed it through and through,\nThrough brows and cheeks and chin, as if to find\nA wicked murderer in my innocent face,\nIf not here, there perhaps. Then, drawing breath,\nShe struggled for her ordinary calm\nAnd missed it rather, -- told me not to shrink,\nAs if she had told me not to lie or swear, --\n`She loved my father, and would love me too\nAs long as I deserved it.' Very kind.\n\n[Book 5]\n\nAURORA LEIGH, be humble.

Go,\nAurora Leigh : be humble.\nThere it is,\nWe women are too apt to look to One,\nWhich proves a certain impotence in art.\nWe strain our natures at doing something great,\nFar less because it 's something great to do,\nThan haply that we, so, commend ourselves\nAs being not small, and more appreciable\nTo some one friend. We must have mediators\nBetwixt our highest conscience and the judge ;\nSome sweet saint's blood must quicken in our palms\nOr all the life in heaven seems slow and cold :\nGood only being perceived as the end of good,\nAnd God alone pleased, -- that's too poor, we think,\nAnd not enough for us by any means.\nAy, Romney, I remember, told me once\nWe miss the abstract when we comprehend.\nWe miss it most when we aspire, -- and fail.\nYet, so, I will not. -- This vile woman's way\nOf trailing garments, shall not trip me up :\nI 'll have no traffic with the personal thought\nIn art's pure temple. Must I work in vain,\nWithout the approbation of a man ?\nIt cannot be ; it shall not. Fame itself,\nThat approbation of the general race,\nPresents a poor end, (though the arrow speed,\nShot straight with vigorous finger to the white,)\nAnd the highest fame was never reached except\nBy what was aimed above it. Art for art,\nAnd good for God Himself, the essential Good !\nWe 'll keep our aims sublime, our eyes erect,\nAlthough our woman-hands should shake and fail ;\nAnd if we fail .. But must we ? --\nShall I fail ?\nThe Greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase,\n`Let no one be called happy till his death.'\nTo which I add, -- Let no one till his death\nBe called unhappy. Measure not the work\nUntil the day 's out and the labour done,\nThen bring your gauges. If the day's work 's scant,\nWhy, call it scant ; affect no compromise ;\nAnd, in that we have nobly striven at least,\nDeal with us nobly, women though we be.\nAnd honour us with truth if not with praise.","title":"Aurora Leigh (excerpts)"},{"lines":"O Rose! who dares to name thee?\nNo longer roseate now, nor soft, nor sweet;\nBut pale, and hard, and dry, as stubble-wheat,---\nKept seven years in a drawer---thy titles shame thee.\n\nThe breeze that used to blow thee\nBetween the hedgerow thorns, and take away\nAn odour up the lane to last all day,---\nIf breathing now,---unsweetened would forego thee.\n\nThe sun that used to smite thee,\nAnd mix his glory in thy gorgeous urn,\nTill beam appeared to bloom, and flower to burn,---\nIf shining now,---with not a hue would light thee.\n\nThe dew that used to wet thee,\nAnd, white first, grow incarnadined, because\nIt lay upon thee where the crimson was,---\nIf dropping now,---would darken where it met thee.\n\nThe fly that lit upon thee,\nTo stretch the tendrils of its tiny feet,\nAlong thy leaf's pure edges, after heat,---\nIf lighting now,---would coldly overrun thee.\n\nThe bee that once did suck thee,\nAnd build thy perfumed ambers up his hive,\nAnd swoon in thee for joy, till scarce alive,---\nIf passing now,---would blindly overlook thee.\n\nThe heart doth recognise thee,\nAlone, alone!

Flanders, all beyond the sea,\nAt Popering  in the place;\nHis father was a man full free,\nAnd lord he was of that country,\nAs it was Godde's grace.\n\nSir Thopas was a doughty swain,\nWhite was his face as paindemain,\nHis lippes red as rose.\nHis rode is like scarlet in grain,\nAnd I you tell in good certain\nHe had a seemly nose.\n\nHis hair, his beard, was like saffroun,\nThat to his girdle reach'd adown,\nHis shoes of cordewane:\nOf Bruges were his hosen brown;\nHis robe was of ciclatoun,\nThat coste many a jane.\n\nHe coulde hunt at the wild deer,\nAnd ride on hawking for rivere\nWith gray goshawk on hand:\nThereto he was a good archere,\nOf wrestling was there none his peer,\nWhere any ram  should stand.\n\nFull many a maiden bright in bow'r\nThey mourned for him par amour,\nWhen them were better sleep;\nBut he was chaste, and no lechour,\nAnd sweet as is the bramble flow'r\nThat beareth the red heep.\n\nAnd so it fell upon a day,\nFor sooth as I you telle may,\nSir Thopas would out ride;\nHe worth upon his steede gray,\nAnd in his hand a launcegay,\nA long sword by his side.\n\nHe pricked through a fair forest,\nWherein is many a wilde beast,\nYea, bothe buck and hare;\nAnd as he pricked north and east,\nI tell it you, him had almest\nBetid a sorry care.\n\nThere sprange herbes great and small,\nThe liquorice and the setewall,\nAnd many a clove-gilofre,\nAnd nutemeg to put in ale,\nWhether it be moist or stale,\nOr for to lay in coffer.\n\nThe birdes sang, it is no nay,\nThe sperhawk and the popinjay,\nThat joy it was to hear;\nThe throstle-cock made eke his lay,\nThe woode-dove upon the spray\nShe sang full loud and clear.\n\nSir Thopas fell in love-longing\nAll when he heard the throstle sing,\nAnd prick'd as he were wood;\nHis faire steed in his pricking\nSo sweated, that men might him wring,\nHis sides were all blood.\n\nSir Thopas eke so weary was\nFor pricking on the softe grass,\nSo fierce was his corage,\nThat down he laid him in that place,\nTo make his steed some solace,\nAnd gave him good forage.\n\n\"Ah, Saint Mary, ben'dicite,\nWhat aileth thilke love at me\nTo binde me so sore?\nMe dreamed all this night, pardie,\nAn

that he first began\nTo riden out, he loved chivalry,\nTruth and honour, freedom and courtesy.\nFull worthy was he in his Lorde's war,\nAnd thereto had he ridden, no man farre,\nAs well in Christendom

also\nSome time with the lord of Palatie,\nAgainst another heathen in Turkie:\nAnd evermore he had a sovereign price.\nAnd though that he was worthy he was wise,\nAnd of his port as meek as is a maid.\nHe never yet no villainy ne said\nIn all his life, unto no manner wight.\nHe was a very perfect gentle knight.\nBut for to telle you of his array,\nHis horse was good, but yet he was not gay.\nOf fustian he weared a gipon,\nAlle besmotter'd with his habergeon,\nFor he was late y-come from his voyage,\nAnd wente for to do his pilgrimage.\n\nWith him there was his son, a younge SQUIRE,\nA lover, and a lusty bacheler,\nWith lockes crulle as they were laid in press.\nOf twenty year of age he was I guess.\nOf his stature he was of even length,\nAnd wonderly deliver, and great of strength.\nAnd he had been some time in chevachie,\nIn Flanders, in Artois, and Picardie,\nAnd borne him well, as of so little space,\nIn hope to standen in his lady's grace.\nEmbroider'd was he, as it were a mead\nAll full of freshe flowers, white and red.\nSinging he was, or fluting all the day;\nHe was as fresh as is the month of May.\nShort was his gown, with sleeves long and wide.\nWell could he sit on horse, and faire ride.\nHe coulde songes make, and well indite,\nJoust, and eke dance, and well pourtray and write.\nSo hot he loved, that by nightertale\nHe slept no more than doth the nightingale.\nCourteous he was, lowly, and serviceable,\nAnd carv'd before his father at the table.\n\nA YEOMAN had he, and servants no mo'\nAt that time, for him list ride so\nAnd he was clad in coat and hood of green.\nA sheaf of peacock arrows bright and keen\nUnder his belt he bare full thriftily.\nWell could he dress his tackle yeomanly:\nHis arrows drooped not with feathers low;\nAnd in his hand he bare a mighty bow.\nA nut-head  had he, with a brown visiage:\nOf wood-craft coud he well all the usage:\nUpon his arm he bare a gay bracer,\nAnd by his side a sword and a buckler,\nAnd on that other side a gay daggere,\nHarnessed well, and sharp as point of spear:\nA Christopher on his breast of silver sheen.\nAn horn he bare, the baldric was of green:\nA forester was he soothly as I guess.\n\nThere was also a Nun, a PRIORESS,\nThat of her smiling was full simple and coy;\nHer greatest oathe was but by Saint Loy;\nAnd she was cleped Madame Eglentine.\nFull well she sang the service divine,\nEntuned in her nose full seemly;\nAnd French she spake full fair and fetisly\nAfter the school of Stratford atte Bow,\nFor French of Paris was to her unknow.\nAt meate was she well y-taught withal;\nShe let no morsel from her lippes fall,\nNor wet her fingers in her sauce deep.\nWell could she carry a morsel, and well keep,\nThat no droppe ne fell upon her breast.\nIn courtesy was set full much her lest.\nHer over-lippe wiped she so clean,\nThat in her cup there was no farthing seen\nOf grease, when she drunken had her draught;\nFull seemely after her meat she raught:\nAnd sickerly she was of great disport,\nAnd full pleasant, and amiable of port,\nAnd pained her to counterfeite cheer\nOf court, and be estately of mannere,\nAnd to be holden digne of reverence.\nBut for to speaken of her conscience,\nShe was so charitable and so pitous,\nShe woulde weep if that she saw a mouse\nCaught in a trap, if it were dead or bled.\nOf smalle houndes had she, that she fed\nWith roasted flesh, and milk, and wastel bread.\nBut sore she wept if one of them were dead,\nOr if men smote it with a yarde smart:\nAnd all was conscience and tender heart.\nFull seemly her wimple y-pinched was;\nHer nose tretis; her eyen gray as glass;\nHer mouth full small, and thereto soft and red;\nBut sickerly she had a fair forehead.\nIt was almost a spanne broad I trow;\nFor hardily she was not undergrow.\nFull fetis was her cloak, as I was ware.\nOf small coral about her arm she bare\nA pair of beades, gauded all with green;\nAnd thereon hung a brooch of gold full sheen,\nOn which was first y-written a crown'd A,\nAnd after, Amor vincit omnia.\nAnother Nun also with her had she,\n[That was her chapelleine, and PRIESTES three.]\n\nA MONK there was, a fair for the mast'ry,\nAn out-rider, that loved venery;\nA manly man, to be an abbot able.\nFull many a dainty horse had he in stable:\nAnd when he rode, men might his bridle hear\nJingeling  in a whistling wind as clear,\nAnd eke as loud, as doth the chapel bell,\nThere as this lord was keeper of the cell.\nThe rule of Saint Maur and of Saint Benet,\nBecause that it was old and somedeal strait\nThis ilke monk let olde thinges pace,\nAnd held after the newe world the trace.\nHe gave not of the text a pulled hen,\nThat saith, that hunters be not holy men:\nNe that a monk, when he is cloisterless;\nIs like to a fish that is waterless;\nThis is to say, a monk out of his cloister.\nThis ilke text held he not worth an oyster;\nAnd I say his opinion was good.\nWhy should he study, and make himselfe wood\nUpon a book in cloister always pore,\nOr swinken with his handes, and labour,\nAs Austin bid? how shall the world be served?\nLet Austin have his swink to him reserved.\nTherefore he was a prickasour aright:\nGreyhounds he had as swift as fowl of flight;\nOf pricking and of hunting for the hare\nWas all his lust, for no cost would he spare.\n I saw his sleeves purfil'd at the hand\nWith gris, and that the finest of the land.\nAnd for to fasten his hood under his chin,\nHe had of gold y-wrought a curious pin;\nA love-knot in the greater end there was.\nHis head was bald, and shone as any glass,\nAnd eke his face, as it had been anoint;\nHe was a lord full fat and in good point;\nHis eyen steep, and rolling in his head,\nThat steamed as a furnace of a lead.\nHis bootes supple, his horse in great estate,\nNow certainly he was a fair prelate;\nHe was not pale as a forpined ghost;\nA fat swan lov'd he best of any roast.\nHis palfrey was as brown as is a berry.\n\nA FRIAR there was, a wanton and a merry,\nA limitour , a full solemne man.\nIn all the orders four is none that can\nSo much of dalliance and fair language.\nHe had y-made full many a marriage\nOf younge women, at his owen cost.\nUnto his order he was a noble post;\nFull well belov'd, and familiar was he\nWith franklins over all in his country,\nAnd eke with worthy women of the town:\nFor he had power of confession,\nAs said himselfe, more than a curate,\nFor of his order he was licentiate.\nFull sweetely heard he confession,\nAnd pleasant was his absolution.\nHe was an easy man to give penance,\nThere as he wist to have a good pittance:\nFor unto a poor order for to give\nIs signe that a man is well y-shrive.\nFor if he gave, he durste make avant,\nHe wiste that the man was repentant.\nFor many a man so hard is of his heart,\nHe may not weep although him sore smart.\nTherefore instead of weeping and prayeres,\nMen must give silver to the poore freres.\nHis tippet was aye farsed full of knives\nAnd pinnes, for to give to faire wives;\nAnd certainly he had a merry note:\nWell could he sing and playen on a rote;\nOf yeddings he bare utterly the prize.\nHis neck was white as is the fleur-de-lis.\nThereto he strong was as a champion,\nAnd knew well the taverns in every town.\nAnd every hosteler and gay tapstere,\nBetter than a lazar or a beggere,\nFor unto such a worthy man as he\nAccordeth not, as by his faculty,\nTo have with such lazars acquaintance.\nIt is not honest, it may not advance,\nAs for to deale with no such pouraille,\nBut all with rich, and sellers of vitaille.\nAnd ov'r all there as profit should arise,\nCourteous he was, and lowly of service;\nThere n'as no man nowhere so virtuous.\nHe was the beste beggar in all his house:\nAnd gave a certain farme for the grant,\nNone of his bretheren came in his haunt.\nFor though a widow hadde but one shoe,\nSo pleasant was his In Principio,\nYet would he have a farthing ere he went;\nHis purchase was well better than his rent.\nAnd rage he could and play as any whelp,\nIn lovedays ; there could he muchel help.\nFor there was he not like a cloisterer,\nWith threadbare cope as is a poor scholer;\nBut he was like a master or a pope.\nOf double worsted was his semicope,\nThat rounded was as a bell out of press.\nSomewhat he lisped for his wantonness,\nTo make his English sweet upon his tongue;\nAnd in his harping, when that he had sung,\nHis eyen twinkled in his head aright,\nAs do the starres in a frosty night.\nThis worthy limitour  was call'd Huberd.\n\nA MERCHANT was there with a forked beard,\nIn motley, and high on his horse he sat,\nUpon his head a Flandrish beaver hat.\nHis bootes clasped fair and fetisly.\nHis reasons aye spake he full solemnly,\nSounding alway th' increase of his winning.\nHe would the sea were kept  for any thing\nBetwixte Middleburg and Orewell\nWell could he in exchange shieldes sell\nThis worthy man full well his wit beset;\nThere wiste no wight that he was in debt,\nSo estately was he of governance\nWith his bargains, and with his chevisance.\nFor sooth he was a worthy man withal,\nBut sooth to say, I n'ot how men him call.\n\nA CLERK there was of Oxenford also,\nThat unto logic hadde long y-go.\nAs leane was his horse as is a rake,\nAnd he was not right fat, I undertake;\nBut looked hollow, and thereto soberly.\nFull threadbare was his overest courtepy,\nFor he had gotten him yet no benefice,\nNe was not worldly, to have an office.\nFor him was lever have at his bed's head\nTwenty bookes, clothed in black or red,\nOf Aristotle, and his philosophy,\nThan robes rich, or fiddle, or psalt'ry.\nBut all be that he was a philosopher,\nYet hadde he but little gold in coffer,\nBut all that he might of his friendes hent,\nOn bookes and on learning he it spent,\nAnd busily gan for the soules pray\nOf them that gave him  wherewith to scholay\nOf study took he moste care and heed.\nNot one word spake he more than was need;\nAnd that was said in form and reverence,\nAnd short and quick, and full of high sentence.\nSounding in moral virtue was his speech,\nAnd gladly would he learn, and gladly teach.\n\nA SERGEANT OF THE LAW, wary and wise,\nThat often had y-been at the Parvis,\nThere was also, full rich of excellence.\nDiscreet he was, and of great reverence:\nHe seemed such, his wordes were so wise,\nJustice he was full often in assize,\nBy patent, and by plein commission;\nFor his science, and for his high renown,\nOf fees and robes had he many one.\nSo great a purchaser was nowhere none.\nAll was fee simple to him, in effect\nHis purchasing might not be in suspect\nNowhere so busy a man as he there was\nAnd yet he seemed busier than he was\nIn termes had he case' and doomes all\nThat from the time of King Will. were fall.\nThereto he could indite, and make a thing\nThere coulde no wight pinch at his writing.\nAnd every statute coud he plain by rote\nHe rode but homely in a medley coat,\nGirt with a seint of silk, with barres small;\nOf his array tell I no longer tale.\n\nA FRANKELIN was in this company;\nWhite was his beard, as is the daisy.\nOf his complexion he was sanguine.\nWell lov'd he in the morn a sop in wine.\nTo liven in delight was ever his won,\nFor he was Epicurus' owen son,\nThat held opinion, that plein delight\nWas verily felicity perfite.\nAn householder, and that a great, was he;\nSaint Julian he was in his country.\nHis bread, his ale, was alway after one;\nA better envined man was nowhere none;\nWithoute bake-meat never was his house,\nOf fish and flesh, and that so plenteous,\nIt snowed in his house of meat and drink,\nOf alle dainties that men coulde think.\nAfter the sundry seasons of the year,\nSo changed he his meat and his soupere.\nFull many a fat partridge had he in mew,\nAnd many a bream, and many a luce in stew\nWoe was his cook, but if his sauce were\nPoignant and sharp, and ready all his gear.\nHis table dormant in his hall alway\nStood ready cover'd all the longe day.\nAt sessions there was he lord and sire.\nFull often time he was knight of the shire\nAn anlace, and a gipciere all of silk,\nHung at his girdle, white as morning milk.\nA sheriff had he been, and a countour\nWas nowhere such a worthy vavasour.\n\n An HABERDASHER, and a CARPENTER,\nA WEBBE, a DYER, and a TAPISER,\nWere with us eke, cloth'd in one livery,\nOf a solemn and great fraternity.\nFull fresh and new their gear y-picked was.\nTheir knives were y-chaped not with brass,\nBut all with silver wrought full clean and well,\nTheir girdles and their pouches every deal.\nWell seemed each of them a fair burgess,\nTo sitten in a guild-hall, on the dais.\nEvereach, for the wisdom that he can,\nWas shapely for to be an alderman.\nFor chattels hadde they enough and rent,\nAnd eke their wives would it well assent:\nAnd elles certain they had been to blame.\nIt is full fair to be y-clep'd madame,\nAnd for to go to vigils all before,\nAnd have a mantle royally y-bore.\n\nA COOK they hadde with them for the nones,\nTo boil the chickens and the marrow bones,\nAnd powder merchant tart and galingale.\nWell could he know a draught of London ale.\nHe could roast, and stew, and broil, and fry,\nMake mortrewes, and well bake a pie.\nBut great harm was it, as it thoughte me,\nThat, on his shin a mormal hadde he.\nFor blanc manger, that made he with the best\n\nA SHIPMAN was there, wonned far by West:\nFor ought I wot, be was of Dartemouth.\nHe rode upon a rouncy, as he couth,\nAll in a gown of falding to the knee.\nA dagger hanging by a lace had he\nAbout his neck under his arm adown;\nThe hot summer had made his hue all brown;\nAnd certainly he was a good fellaw.\nFull many a draught of wine he had y-draw\nFrom Bourdeaux-ward, while that the chapmen sleep;\nOf nice conscience took he no keep.\nIf that he fought, and had the higher hand,\nBy water he sent them home to every land.\nBut of his craft to reckon well his tides,\nHis streames and his strandes him besides,\nHis herberow, his moon, and lodemanage,\nThere was none such, from Hull unto Carthage\nHardy he was, and wise, I undertake:\nWith many a tempest had his beard been shake.\nHe knew well all the havens, as they were,\nFrom Scotland to the Cape of Finisterre,\nAnd every creek in Bretagne and in Spain:\nHis barge y-cleped was the Magdelain.\n\nWith us there was a DOCTOR OF PHYSIC;\nIn all this worlde was there none him like\nTo speak of physic, and of surgery:\nFor he was grounded in astronomy.\nHe kept his patient a full great deal\nIn houres by his magic natural.\nWell could he fortune the ascendent\nOf his images for his patient,.\nHe knew the cause of every malady,\nWere it of cold, or hot, or moist, or dry,\nAnd where engender'd, and of what humour.\nHe was a very  perfect practisour\nThe cause y-know, and of his harm the root,\nAnon he gave to the sick man his boot\nFull ready had he his apothecaries,\nTo send his drugges and his lectuaries\nFor each of them made other for to win\nTheir friendship was not newe to begin\nWell knew he the old Esculapius,\nAnd Dioscorides, and eke Rufus;\nOld Hippocras, Hali, and Gallien;\nSerapion, Rasis, and Avicen;\nAverrois, Damascene, and Constantin;\nBernard, and Gatisden, and Gilbertin.\nOf his diet measurable was he,\nFor it was of no superfluity,\nBut of great nourishing, and digestible.\nHis study was but little on the Bible.\nIn sanguine and in perse he clad was all\nLined with taffeta, and with sendall.\nAnd yet he was but easy of dispense:\nHe kept that he won in the pestilence.\nFor gold in physic is a cordial;\nTherefore he loved gold in special.\n\nA good WIFE was there OF beside BATH,\nBut she was somedeal deaf, and that was scath.\nOf cloth-making she hadde such an haunt,\nShe passed them of Ypres, and of Gaunt.\nIn all the parish wife was there none,\nThat to the off'ring before her should gon,\nAnd if there did, certain so wroth was she,\nThat she was out of alle charity\nHer coverchiefs were full fine of ground\nI durste swear, they weighede ten pound\nThat on the Sunday were upon her head.\nHer hosen weren of fine scarlet red,\nFull strait y-tied, and shoes full moist and new\nBold was her face, and fair and red of hue.\nShe was a worthy woman all her live,\nHusbands at the church door had she had five,\nWithouten other company in youth;\nBut thereof needeth not to speak as nouth.\nAnd thrice had she been at Jerusalem;\nShe hadde passed many a strange stream\nAt Rome she had been, and at Bologne,\nIn Galice at Saint James,  and at Cologne;\nShe coude much of wand'rng by the Way.\nGat-toothed was she, soothly for to say.\nUpon an ambler easily she sat,\nY-wimpled well, and on her head an hat\nAs broad as is a buckler or a targe.\nA foot-mantle about her hippes large,\nAnd on her feet a pair of spurres sharp.\nIn fellowship well could she laugh and carp\nOf remedies of love she knew perchance\nFor of that art she coud the olde dance.\n\nA good man there was of religion,\nThat was a poore PARSON of a town:\nBut rich he was of holy thought and werk.\nHe was also a learned man, a clerk,\nThat Christe's gospel truly woulde preach.\nHis parishens devoutly would he teach.\nBenign he was, and wonder diligent,\nAnd in adversity full patient:\nAnd such he was y-proved often sithes.\nFull loth were him to curse for his tithes,\nBut rather would he given out of doubt,\nUnto his poore parishens about,\nOf his off'ring, and eke of his substance.\nHe could in little thing have suffisance.\nWide was his parish, and houses far asunder,\nBut he ne left not, for no rain nor thunder,\nIn sickness and in mischief to visit\nThe farthest in his parish, much and lit,\nUpon his feet, and in his hand a staff.\nThis noble ensample to his sheep he gaf,\nThat first he wrought, and afterward he taught.\nOut of the gospel he the wordes caught,\nAnd this figure he added yet thereto,\nThat if gold ruste, what should iron do?\nFor if a priest be foul, on whom we trust,\nNo wonder is a lewed man to rust:\nAnd shame it is, if that a priest take keep,\nTo see a shitten shepherd and clean sheep:\nWell ought a priest ensample for to give,\nBy his own cleanness, how his sheep should live.\nHe sette not his benefice to hire,\nAnd left his sheep eucumber'd in the mire,\nAnd ran unto London, unto Saint Paul's,\nTo seeke him a chantery for souls,\nOr with a brotherhood to be withold:\nBut dwelt at home, and kepte well his fold,\nSo that the wolf ne made it not miscarry.\nHe was a shepherd, and no mercenary.\nAnd though he holy were, and virtuous,\nHe was to sinful men not dispitous\nNor of his speeche dangerous nor dign\nBut in his teaching discreet and benign.\nTo drawen folk to heaven, with fairness,\nBy good ensample, was his business:\nBut it were any person obstinate,\nWhat so he were of high or low estate,\nHim would he snibbe sharply for the nones.\nA better priest I trow that nowhere none is.\nHe waited after no pomp nor reverence,\nNor maked him a spiced conscience,\nBut Christe's lore, and his apostles' twelve,\nHe taught, and first he follow'd it himselve.\n\nWith him there was a PLOUGHMAN, was his brother,\nThat had y-laid of dung full many a fother.\nA true swinker and a good was he,\nLiving in peace and perfect charity.\nGod loved he beste with all his heart\nAt alle times, were it gain or smart,\nAnd then his neighebour right as himselve.\nHe woulde thresh, and thereto dike, and delve,\nFor Christe's sake, for every poore wight,\nWithouten hire, if it lay in his might.\nHis tithes payed he full fair and well,\nBoth of his proper swink, and his chattel\nIn a tabard he rode upon a mare.\n\nThere was also a Reeve, and a Millere,\nA Sompnour, and a Pardoner also,\nA Manciple, and myself, there were no mo'.\n\nThe MILLER was a stout carle for the nones,\nFull big he was of brawn, and eke of bones;\nThat proved well, for ov'r all where he came,\nAt wrestling he would bear away the ram.\nHe was short-shouldered, broad, a thicke gnarr,\nThere was no door, that he n'old heave off bar,\nOr break it at a running with his head.\nHis beard as any sow or fox was red,\nAnd thereto broad, as though it were a spade.\nUpon the cop right of his nose he had\nA wart, and thereon stood a tuft of hairs\nRed as the bristles of a sowe's ears.\nHis nose-thirles blacke were and wide.\nA sword and buckler bare he by his side.\nHis mouth as wide was as a furnace.\nHe was a jangler, and a goliardais,\nAnd that was most of sin and harlotries.\nWell could he steale corn, and tolle thrice\nAnd yet he had a thumb of gold, pardie.\nA white coat and a blue hood weared he\nA baggepipe well could he blow and soun',\nAnd therewithal he brought us out of town.\n\nA gentle MANCIPLE  was there of a temple,\nOf which achatours mighte take ensample\nFor to be wise in buying of vitaille.\nFor whether that he paid, or took by taile,\nAlgate he waited so in his achate,\nThat he was aye before in good estate.\nNow is not that of God a full fair grace\nThat such a lewed mannes wit shall pace\nThe wisdom of an heap of learned men?\nOf masters had he more than thries ten,\nThat were of law expert and curious:\nOf which there was a dozen in that house,\nWorthy to be stewards of rent and land\nOf any lord that is in Engleland,\nTo make him live by his proper good,\nIn honour debtless, but if he were wood,\nOr live as scarcely as him list desire;\nAnd able for to helpen all a shire\nIn any case that mighte fall or hap;\nAnd yet this Manciple set their aller cap\n\nThe REEVE  was a slender choleric man\nHis beard was shav'd as nigh as ever he can.\nHis hair was by his eares round y-shorn;\nHis top was docked like a priest beforn\nFull longe were his legges, and full lean\nY-like a staff, there was no calf y-seen\nWell could he keep a garner and a bin\nThere was no auditor could on him win\nWell wist he by the drought, and by the rain,\nThe yielding of his seed and of his grain\nHis lorde's sheep, his neat, and his dairy\nHis swine, his horse, his store, and his poultry,\nWere wholly in this Reeve's governing,\nAnd by his cov'nant gave he reckoning,\nSince that his lord was twenty year of age;\nThere could no man bring him in arrearage\nThere was no bailiff, herd, nor other hine\nThat he ne knew his sleight and his covine\nThey were adrad of him, as of the death\nHis wonning was full fair upon an heath\nWith greene trees y-shadow'd was his place.\nHe coulde better than his lord purchase\nFull rich he was y-stored privily\nHis lord well could he please subtilly,\nTo give and lend him of his owen good,\nAnd have a thank, and yet a coat and hood.\nIn youth he learned had a good mistere\nHe was a well good wright, a carpentere\nThis Reeve sate upon a right good stot,\nThat was all pomely gray, and highte Scot.\nA long surcoat of perse upon he had,\nAnd by his side he bare a rusty blade.\nOf Norfolk was this Reeve, of which I tell,\nBeside a town men clepen Baldeswell,\nTucked he was, as is a friar, about,\nAnd ever rode the hinderest of the rout.\n\nA SOMPNOUR was there with us in that place,\nThat had a fire-red cherubinnes face,\nFor sausefleme he was, with eyen narrow.\nAs hot he was and lecherous as a sparrow,\nWith scalled browes black, and pilled beard:\nOf his visage children were sore afeard.\nThere n'as quicksilver, litharge, nor brimstone,\nBoras, ceruse, nor oil of tartar none,\nNor ointement that woulde cleanse or bite,\nThat him might helpen of his whelkes white,\nNor of the knobbes sitting on his cheeks.\nWell lov'd he garlic, onions, and leeks,\nAnd for to drink strong wine as red as blood.\nThen would he speak, and cry as he were wood;\nAnd when that he well drunken had the wine,\nThen would he speake no word but Latin.\nA fewe termes knew he, two or three,\nThat he had learned out of some decree;\nNo wonder is, he heard it all the day.\nAnd eke ye knowen well, how that a jay\nCan clepen \"Wat,\" as well as can the Pope.\nBut whoso would in other thing him grope,\nThen had he spent all his philosophy,\nAye, Questio quid juris, would he cry.\n\nHe was a gentle harlot and a kind;\nA better fellow should a man not find.\nHe woulde suffer, for a quart of wine,\nA good fellow to have his concubine\nA twelvemonth, and excuse him at the full.\nFull privily a finch eke could he pull.\nAnd if he found owhere a good fellaw,\nHe woulde teache him to have none awe\nIn such a case of the archdeacon's curse;\nBut if a manne's soul were in his purse;\nFor in his purse he should y-punished be.\n\"Purse is the archedeacon's hell,\" said he.\nBut well I wot, he lied right indeed:\nOf cursing ought each guilty man to dread,\nFor curse will slay right as assoiling saveth;\nAnd also 'ware him of a significavit.\nIn danger had he at his owen guise\nThe younge girles of the diocese,\nAnd knew their counsel, and was of their rede.\nA garland had he set upon his head,\nAs great as it were for an alestake:\nA buckler had he made him of a cake.\n\nWith him there rode a gentle PARDONERE\nOf Ronceval, his friend and his compere,\nThat straight was comen from the court of Rome.\nFull loud he sang, \"Come hither, love, to me\"\nThis Sompnour bare to him a stiff burdoun,\nWas never trump of half so great a soun'.\nThis Pardoner had hair as yellow as wax,\nBut smooth it hung, as doth a strike of flax:\nBy ounces hung his lockes that he had,\nAnd therewith he his shoulders oversprad.\nFull thin it lay, by culpons one and one,\nBut hood for jollity, he weared none,\nFor it was trussed up in his wallet.\nHim thought he rode all of the newe get,\nDishevel, save his cap, he rode all bare.\nSuch glaring eyen had he, as an hare.\nA vernicle had he sew'd upon his cap.\nHis wallet lay before him in his lap,\nBretful of pardon come from Rome all hot.\nA voice he had as small as hath a goat.\nNo beard had he, nor ever one should have.\nAs smooth it was as it were new y-shave;\nI trow he were a gelding or a mare.\nBut of his craft, from Berwick unto Ware,\nNe was there such another pardonere.\nFor in his mail he had a pillowbere,\nWhich, as he saide, was our Lady's veil:\nHe said, he had a gobbet of the sail\nThat Sainte Peter had, when that he went\nUpon the sea, till Jesus Christ him hent.\nHe had a cross of latoun full of stones,\nAnd in a glass he hadde pigge's bones.\nBut with these relics, whenne that he fond\nA poore parson dwelling upon lond,\nUpon a day he got him more money\nThan that the parson got in moneths tway;\nAnd thus with feigned flattering and japes,\nHe made the parson and the people his apes.\nBut truely to tellen at the last,\nHe was in church a noble ecclesiast.\nWell could he read a lesson or a story,\nBut alderbest he sang an offertory:\nFor well he wiste, when that song was sung,\nHe muste preach, and well afile his tongue,\nTo winne silver, as he right well could:\nTherefore he sang full merrily and loud.\n\nNow have I told you shortly in a clause\nTh' estate, th' array, the number, and eke the cause\nWhy that assembled was this company\nIn Southwark at this gentle hostelry,\nThat highte the Tabard, fast by the Bell.\nBut now is time to you for to tell\nHow that we baren us that ilke night,\nWhen we were in that hostelry alight.\nAnd after will I tell of our voyage,\nAnd all the remnant of our pilgrimage.\nBut first I pray you of your courtesy,\nThat ye arette it not my villainy,\nThough that I plainly speak in this mattere.\nTo tellen you their wordes and their cheer;\nNot though I speak their wordes properly.\nFor this ye knowen all so well as I,\nWhoso shall tell a tale after a man,\nHe must rehearse, as nigh as ever he can,\nEvery word, if it be in his charge,\nAll speak he ne'er so rudely and so large;\nOr elles he must tell his tale untrue,\nOr feigne things, or finde wordes new.\nHe may not spare, although he were his brother;\nHe must as well say one word as another.\nChrist spake Himself full broad in Holy Writ,\nAnd well ye wot no villainy is it.\nEke Plato saith, whoso that can him read,\nThe wordes must be cousin to the deed.\nAlso I pray you to forgive it me,\nAll have I not set folk in their degree,\nHere in this tale, as that they shoulden stand:\nMy wit is short, ye may well understand.\n\nGreat cheere made our Host us every one,\nAnd to the supper set he us anon:\nAnd served us with victual of the best.\nStrong was the wine, and well to drink us lest.\nA seemly man Our Hoste was withal\nFor to have been a marshal in an hall.\nA large man he was with eyen steep,\nA fairer burgess is there none in Cheap:\nBold of his speech, and wise and well y-taught,\nAnd of manhoode lacked him right naught.\nEke thereto was he right a merry man,\nAnd after supper playen he began,\nAnd spake of mirth amonges other things,\nWhen that we hadde made our reckonings;\nAnd saide thus; \"Now, lordinges, truly\nYe be to me welcome right heartily:\nFor by my troth, if that I shall not lie,\nI saw not this year such a company\nAt once in this herberow, am is now.\nFain would I do you mirth, an I wist how.\nAnd of a mirth I am right now bethought.\nTo do you ease, and it shall coste nought.\nYe go to Canterbury; God you speed,\nThe blissful Martyr quite you your meed;\nAnd well I wot, as ye go by the way,\nYe shapen you to talken and to play:\nFor truely comfort nor mirth is none\nTo ride by the way as dumb as stone:\nAnd therefore would I make you disport,\nAs I said erst, and do you some comfort.\nAnd if you liketh all by one assent\nNow for to standen at my judgement,\nAnd for to worken as I shall you say\nTo-morrow, when ye riden on the way,\nNow by my father's soule that is dead,\nBut ye be merry, smiteth off mine head.\nHold up your hands withoute more speech.\n\nOur counsel was not longe for to seech:\nUs thought it was not worth to make it wise,\nAnd granted him withoute more avise,\nAnd bade him say his verdict, as him lest.\nLordings (quoth he), now hearken for the best;\nBut take it not, I pray you, in disdain;\nThis is the point, to speak it plat and plain.\nThat each of you, to shorten with your way\nIn this voyage, shall tellen tales tway,\nTo Canterbury-ward, I mean it so,\nAnd homeward he shall tellen other two,\nOf aventures that whilom have befall.\nAnd which of you that bear'th him best of all,\nThat is to say, that telleth in this case\nTales of best sentence and most solace,\nShall have a supper at your aller cost\nHere in this place, sitting by this post,\nWhen that ye come again from Canterbury.\nAnd for to make you the more merry,\nI will myselfe gladly with you ride,\nRight at mine owen cost, and be your guide.\nAnd whoso will my judgement withsay,\nShall pay for all we spenden by the way.\nAnd if ye vouchesafe that it be so,\nTell me anon withoute wordes mo',\nAnd I will early shape me therefore.\"\n\nThis thing was granted, and our oath we swore\nWith full glad heart, and prayed him also,\nThat he would vouchesafe for to do so,\nAnd that he woulde be our governour,\nAnd of our tales judge and reportour,\nAnd set a supper at a certain price;\nAnd we will ruled be at his device,\nIn high and low: and thus by one assent,\nWe be accorded to his judgement.\nAnd thereupon the wine was fet anon.\nWe drunken, and to reste went each one,\nWithouten any longer tarrying\nA-morrow, when the day began to spring,\nUp rose our host, and was our aller cock,\nAnd gather'd us together in a flock,\nAnd forth we ridden all a little space,\nUnto the watering of Saint Thomas:\nAnd there our host began his horse arrest,\nAnd saide; \"Lordes, hearken if you lest.\nYe weet your forword, and I it record.\nIf even-song and morning-song accord,\nLet see now who shall telle the first tale.\nAs ever may I drinke wine or ale,\nWhoso is rebel to my judgement,\nShall pay for all that by the way is spent.\nNow draw ye cuts, ere that ye farther twin.\nHe which that hath the shortest shall begin.\"\n\n\"Sir Knight (quoth he), my master and my lord,\nNow draw the cut, for that is mine accord.\nCome near (quoth he), my Lady Prioress,\nAnd ye, Sir Clerk, let be your shamefastness,\nNor study not: lay hand to, every man.\"\nAnon to drawen every wight began,\nAnd shortly for to tellen as it was,\nWere it by a venture, or sort, or cas,\nThe sooth is this, the cut fell to the Knight,\nOf which full blithe and glad was every wight;\nAnd tell he must his tale as was reason,\nBy forword, and by composition,\nAs ye have heard; what needeth wordes mo'?\nAnd when this good man saw that it was so,\nAs he that wise was and obedient\nTo keep his forword by his free assent,\nHe said; \"Sithen I shall begin this game,\nWhy,

\"Have ye so great envy\nOf mine honour, that thus complain and cry?\nOr who hath you misboden, or offended?\nDo telle me, if it may be amended;\nAnd why that ye be clad thus all in black?\"\n\nThe oldest lady of them all then spake,\nWhen she had swooned, with a deadly cheer,\nThat it was ruthe for to see or hear.\nShe saide; \"Lord, to whom fortune hath given\nVict'ry, and as a conqueror to liven,\nNought grieveth us your glory and your honour;\nBut we beseechen mercy and succour.\nHave mercy on our woe and our distress;\nSome drop of pity, through thy gentleness,\nUpon us wretched women let now fall.\nFor certes, lord, there is none of us all\nThat hath not been a duchess or a queen;\nNow be we caitives, as it is well seen:\nThanked be Fortune, and her false wheel,\nThat none estate ensureth to be wele.\nAnd certes, lord, t'abiden your presence\nHere in this temple of the goddess Clemence\nWe have been waiting all this fortenight:\nNow help us, lord, since it lies in thy might.\n\n\"I, wretched wight, that weep and waile thus,\nWas whilom wife to king Capaneus,\nThat starf at Thebes, cursed be that day:\nAnd alle we that be in this array,\nAnd maken all this lamentatioun,\nWe losten all our husbands at that town,\nWhile that the siege thereabouten lay.\nAnd yet the olde Creon, wellaway!\nThat lord is now of Thebes the city,\nFulfilled of ire and of iniquity,\nHe for despite, and for his tyranny,\nTo do the deade bodies villainy,\nOf all our lorde's, which that been y-slaw,\nHath all the bodies on an heap y-draw,\nAnd will not suffer them by none assent\nNeither to be y-buried, nor y-brent,\nBut maketh houndes eat them in despite.\"\nAnd with that word, withoute more respite\nThey fallen groff, and cryden piteously;\n\"Have on us wretched women some mercy,\nAnd let our sorrow sinken in thine heart.\"\n\nThis gentle Duke down from his courser start\nWith hearte piteous, when he heard them speak.\nHim thoughte that his heart would all to-break,\nWhen he saw them so piteous and so mate\nThat whilom weren of so great estate.\nAnd in his armes he them all up hent,\nAnd them comforted in full good intent,\nAnd swore his oath, as he was true knight,\nHe woulde do so farforthly his might\nUpon the tyrant Creon them to wreak,\nThat all the people of Greece shoulde speak,\nHow Creon was of Theseus y-served,\nAs he that had his death full well deserved.\nAnd right anon withoute more abode\nHis banner he display'd, and forth he rode\nTo Thebes-ward, and all his, host beside:\nNo ner Athenes would he go nor ride,\nNor take his ease fully half a day,\nBut onward on his way that night he lay:\nAnd sent anon Hippolyta the queen,\nAnd Emily her younge sister sheen\nUnto the town of Athens for to dwell:\nAnd forth he rit; there is no more to tell.\n\nThe red statue of Mars with spear and targe\nSo shineth in his white banner large\nThat all the fieldes glitter up and down:\nAnd by his banner borne is his pennon\nOf gold full rich, in which there was y-beat\nThe Minotaur which that he slew in Crete\nThus rit this Duke, thus rit this conqueror\nAnd in his host of chivalry the flower,\nTill that he came to Thebes, and alight\nFair in a field, there as he thought to fight.\nBut shortly for to speaken of this thing,\nWith Creon, which that was of Thebes king,\nHe fought, and slew him manly as a knight\nIn plain bataille, and put his folk to flight:\nAnd by assault he won the city after,\nAnd rent adown both wall, and spar, and rafter;\nAnd to the ladies he restored again\nThe bodies of their husbands that were slain,\nTo do obsequies, as was then the guise.\n\nBut it were all too long for to devise\nThe greate clamour, and the waimenting,\nWhich that the ladies made at the brenning\nOf the bodies, and the great honour\nThat Theseus the noble conqueror\nDid to the ladies, when they from him went:\nBut shortly for to tell is mine intent.\nWhen that this worthy Duke, this Theseus,\nHad Creon slain, and wonnen Thebes thus,\nStill in the field he took all night his rest,\nAnd did with all the country as him lest.\nTo ransack in the tas of bodies dead,\nThem for to strip of harness and of weed,\nThe pillers did their business and cure,\nAfter the battle and discomfiture.\nAnd so befell, that in the tas they found,\nThrough girt with many a grievous bloody wound,\nTwo younge knightes ligging by and by\nBoth in one armes, wrought full richely:\nOf whiche two, Arcita hight that one,\nAnd he that other highte Palamon.\nNot fully quick, nor fully dead they were,\nBut by their coat-armour, and by their gear,\nThe heralds knew them well in special,\nAs those that weren of the blood royal\nOf Thebes, and of sistren two y-born.\nOut of the tas the pillers have them torn,\nAnd have them carried soft unto the tent\nOf Theseus, and he full soon them sent\nTo Athens, for to dwellen in prison\nPerpetually, he n'olde no ranson.\nAnd when this worthy Duke had thus y-done,\nHe took his host, and home he rit anon\nWith laurel crowned as a conquerour;\nAnd there he lived in joy and in honour\nTerm of his life; what needeth wordes mo'?\nAnd in a tower, in anguish and in woe,\nDwellen this Palamon, and eke Arcite,\nFor evermore, there may no gold them quite\n\nThus passed year by year, and day by day,\nTill it fell ones in a morn of May\nThat Emily, that fairer was to seen\nThan is the lily upon his stalke green,\nAnd fresher than the May with flowers new\n(For with the rose colour strove her hue;\nI n'ot which was the finer of them two),\nEre it was day, as she was wont to do,\nShe was arisen, and all ready dight,\nFor May will have no sluggardy a-night;\nThe season pricketh every gentle heart,\nAnd maketh him out of his sleep to start,\nAnd saith, \"Arise, and do thine observance.\"\n\nThis maketh Emily have remembrance\nTo do honour to May, and for to rise.\nY-clothed was she fresh for to devise;\nHer yellow hair was braided in a tress,\nBehind her back, a yarde long I guess.\nAnd in the garden at the sun uprist\nShe walketh up and down where as her list.\nShe gathereth flowers, party white and red,\nTo make a sotel garland for her head,\nAnd as an angel heavenly she sung.\nThe greate tower, that was so thick and strong,\nWhich of the castle was the chief dungeon\n(Where as these knightes weren in prison,\nOf which I tolde you, and telle shall),\nWas even joinant to the garden wall,\nThere as this Emily had her playing.\n\nBright was the sun, and clear that morrowning,\nAnd Palamon, this woful prisoner,\nAs was his wont, by leave of his gaoler,\nWas ris'n, and roamed in a chamber on high,\nIn which he all the noble city sigh,\nAnd eke the garden, full of branches green,\nThere as this fresh Emelia the sheen\nWas in her walk, and roamed up and down.\nThis sorrowful prisoner, this Palamon\nWent in his chamber roaming to and fro,\nAnd to himself complaining of his woe:\nThat he was born, full oft he said, Alas!\nAnd so befell, by aventure or cas,\nThat through a window thick of many a bar\nOf iron great, and square as any spar,\nHe cast his eyes upon Emelia,\nAnd therewithal he blent and cried, Ah!\nAs though he stungen were unto the heart.\nAnd with that cry Arcite anon up start,\nAnd saide, \"Cousin mine, what aileth thee,\nThat art so pale and deadly for to see?\nWhy cried'st thou? who hath thee done offence?\nFor Godde's love, take all in patience\nOur prison, for it may none other be.\nFortune hath giv'n us this adversity'.\nSome wick' aspect or disposition\nOf Saturn, by some constellation,\nHath giv'n us this, although we had it sworn,\nSo stood the heaven when that we were born,\nWe must endure; this is the short and plain.\n\nThis Palamon answer'd, and said again:\n\"Cousin, forsooth of this opinion\nThou hast a vain imagination.\nThis prison caused me not for to cry;\nBut I was hurt right now thorough mine eye\nInto mine heart; that will my bane be.\nThe fairness of the lady that I see\nYond in the garden roaming to and fro,\nIs cause of all my crying and my woe.\nI n'ot wher she be woman or goddess,\nBut Venus is it, soothly as I guess,\nAnd therewithal on knees adown he fill,\nAnd saide: \"Venus, if it be your will\nYou in this garden thus to transfigure\nBefore me sorrowful wretched creature,\nOut of this prison help that we may scape.\nAnd if so be our destiny be shape\nBy etern word to dien in prison,\nOf our lineage have some compassion,\nThat is so low y-brought by tyranny.\"\n\nAnd with that word Arcita gan espy\nWhere as this lady roamed to and fro\nAnd with that sight her beauty hurt him so,\nThat if that Palamon was wounded sore,\nArcite is hurt as much as he, or more.\nAnd with a sigh he saide piteously:\n\"The freshe beauty slay'th me suddenly\nOf her that roameth yonder in the place.\nAnd but I have her mercy and her grace,\nThat I may see her at the leaste way,\nI am but dead; there is no more to say.\"\nThis Palamon, when he these wordes heard,\nDispiteously he looked, and answer'd:\n\"Whether say'st thou this in earnest or in play?\"\n\"Nay,\" quoth Arcite, \"in earnest, by my fay.\nGod help me so, me lust full ill to play.\"\nThis Palamon gan knit his browes tway.\n\"It were,\" quoth he, \"to thee no great honour\nFor to be false, nor for to be traitour\nTo me, that am thy cousin and thy brother\nY-sworn full deep, and each of us to other,\nThat never for to dien in the pain ,\nTill that the death departen shall us twain,\nNeither of us in love to hinder other,\nNor in none other case, my leve brother;\nBut that thou shouldest truly farther me\nIn every case, as I should farther thee.\nThis was thine oath, and mine also certain;\nI wot it well, thou dar'st it not withsayn,\nThus art thou of my counsel out of doubt,\nAnd now thou wouldest falsely be about\nTo love my lady, whom I love and serve,\nAnd ever shall, until mine hearte sterve\nNow certes, false Arcite, thou shalt not so\nI lov'd her first, and tolde thee my woe\nAs to my counsel, and my brother sworn\nTo farther me, as I have told beforn.\nFor which thou art y-bounden as a knight\nTo helpe me, if it lie in thy might,\nOr elles art thou false, I dare well sayn,\"\n\nThis Arcita full proudly spake again:\n\"Thou shalt,\" quoth he, \"be rather false than I,\nAnd thou art false, I tell thee utterly;\nFor par amour I lov'd her first ere thou.\nWhat wilt thou say? thou wist it not right now\nWhether she be a woman or goddess.\nThine is affection of holiness,\nAnd mine is love, as to a creature:\nFor which I tolde thee mine aventure\nAs to my cousin, and my brother sworn\nI pose, that thou loved'st her beforn:\nWost thou not well the olde clerke's saw,\nThat who shall give a lover any law?\nLove is a greater lawe, by my pan,\nThan may be giv'n to any earthly man:\nTherefore positive law, and such decree,\nIs broke alway for love in each degree\nA man must needes love, maugre his head.\nHe may not flee it, though he should be dead,\nAll be she maid, or widow, or else wife.\nAnd eke it is not likely all thy life\nTo standen in her grace, no more than I\nFor well thou wost thyselfe verily,\nThat thou and I be damned to prison\nPerpetual, us gaineth no ranson.\nWe strive, as did the houndes for the bone;\nThey fought all day, and yet their part was none.\nThere came a kite, while that they were so wroth,\nAnd bare away the bone betwixt them both.\nAnd therefore at the kinge's court, my brother,\nEach man for himselfe, there is no  other.\nLove if thee list; for I love and aye shall\nAnd soothly, leve brother, this is all.\nHere in this prison musten we endure,\nAnd each of us take his Aventure.\"\n\nGreat was the strife and long between these tway,\nIf that I hadde leisure for to say;\nBut to the effect: it happen'd on a day\n(To tell it you as shortly as I may),\nA worthy duke that hight Perithous\nThat fellow was to the Duke Theseus\nSince thilke day that they were children lite\nWas come to Athens, his fellow to visite,\nAnd for to play, as he was wont to do;\nFor in this world he loved no man so;\nAnd he lov'd him as tenderly again.\nSo well they lov'd, as olde bookes sayn,\nThat when that one was dead, soothly to sayn,\nHis fellow went and sought him down in hell:\nBut of that story list me not to write.\nDuke Perithous loved well Arcite,\nAnd had him known at Thebes year by year:\nAnd finally at request and prayere\nOf Perithous, withoute ranson\nDuke Theseus him let out of prison,\nFreely to go, where him list over all,\nIn such a guise, as I you tellen shall\nThis was the forword, plainly to indite,\nBetwixte Theseus and him Arcite:\nThat if so were, that Arcite were y-found\nEver in his life, by day or night, one stound\nIn any country of this Theseus,\nAnd he were caught, it was accorded thus,\nThat with a sword he shoulde lose his head;\nThere was none other remedy nor rede.\nBut took his leave, and homeward he him sped;\nLet him beware, his necke lieth to wed.\n\nHow great a sorrow suff'reth now Arcite!\nThe death he feeleth through his hearte smite;\nHe weepeth, waileth, crieth piteously;\nTo slay himself he waiteth privily.\nHe said; \"Alas the day that I was born!\nNow is my prison worse than beforn:\nNow is me shape eternally to dwell\nNot in purgatory, but right in hell.\nAlas! that ever I knew Perithous.\nFor elles had I dwelt with Theseus\nY-fettered in his prison evermo'.\nThen had I been in bliss, and not in woe.\nOnly the sight of her, whom that I serve,\nThough that I never may her grace deserve,\nWould have sufficed right enough for me.\nO deare cousin Palamon,\" quoth he,\n\"Thine is the vict'ry of this aventure,\nFull blissfully in prison to endure:\nIn prison? nay certes, in paradise.\nWell hath fortune y-turned thee the dice,\nThat hast the sight of her, and I th' absence.\nFor possible is, since thou hast her presence,\nAnd art a knight, a worthy and an able,\nThat by some cas, since fortune is changeable,\nThou may'st to thy desire sometime attain.\nBut I that am exiled, and barren\nOf alle grace, and in so great despair,\nThat there n'is earthe, water, fire, nor air,\nNor creature, that of them maked is,\nThat may me helpe nor comfort in this,\nWell ought I sterve in wanhope and distress.\nFarewell my life, my lust, and my gladness.\nAlas, why plainen men so in commune\nOf purveyance of God, or of Fortune,\nThat giveth them full oft in many a guise\nWell better than they can themselves devise?\nSome man desireth for to have richess,\nThat cause is of his murder or great sickness.\nAnd some man would out of his prison fain,\nThat in his house is of his meinie slain.\nInfinite harmes be in this mattere.\nWe wot never what thing we pray for here.\nWe fare as he that drunk is as a mouse.\nA drunken man wot well he hath an house,\nBut he wot not which is the right way thither,\nAnd to a drunken man the way is slither.\nAnd certes in this world so fare we.\nWe seeke fast after felicity,\nBut we go wrong full often truely.\nThus we may sayen all, and namely I,\nThat ween'd, and had a great opinion,\nThat if I might escape from prison\nThen had I been in joy and perfect heal,\nWhere now I am exiled from my weal.\nSince that I may not see you, Emily,\nI am but dead; there is no remedy.\"\n\nUpon that other side, Palamon,\nWhen that he wist Arcita was agone,\nMuch sorrow maketh, that the greate tower\nResounded of his yelling and clamour\nThe pure fetters on his shinnes great\nWere of his bitter salte teares wet.\n\n\"Alas!\" quoth he, \"Arcita, cousin mine,\nOf all our strife, God wot, the fruit is thine.\nThou walkest now in Thebes at thy large,\nAnd of my woe thou givest little charge.\nThou mayst, since thou hast wisdom and manhead,\nAssemble all the folk of our kindred,\nAnd make a war so sharp on this country\nThat by some aventure, or some treaty,\nThou mayst have her to lady and to wife,\nFor whom that I must needes lose my life.\nFor as by way of possibility,\nSince thou art at thy large, of prison free,\nAnd art a lord, great is thine avantage,\nMore than is mine, that sterve here in a cage.\nFor I must weep and wail, while that I live,\nWith all the woe that prison may me give,\nAnd eke with pain that love me gives also,\nThat doubles all my torment and my woe.\"\n\nTherewith the fire of jealousy upstart\nWithin his breast, and hent him by the heart\nSo woodly, that he like was to behold\nThe box-tree, or the ashes dead and cold.\nThen said; \"O cruel goddess, that govern\nThis world with binding of your word etern\nAnd writen in the table of adamant\nYour parlement and your eternal grant,\nWhat is mankind more unto you y-hold\nThan is the sheep, that rouketh in the fold!\nFor slain is man, right as another beast;\nAnd dwelleth eke in prison and arrest,\nAnd hath sickness, and great adversity,\nAnd oftentimes guilteless, pardie\nWhat governance is in your prescience,\nThat guilteless tormenteth innocence?\nAnd yet increaseth this all my penance,\nThat man is bounden to his observance\nFor Godde's sake to letten of his will,\nWhereas a beast may all his lust fulfil.\nAnd when a beast is dead, he hath no pain;\nBut man after his death must weep and plain,\nThough in this worlde he have care and woe:\nWithoute doubt it maye standen so.\n\"The answer of this leave I to divines,\nBut well I wot, that in this world great pine is;\nAlas! I see a serpent or a thief\nThat many a true man hath done mischief,\nGo at his large, and where him list may turn.\nBut I must be in prison through Saturn,\nAnd eke through Juno, jealous and eke wood,\nThat hath well nigh destroyed all the blood\nOf Thebes, with his waste walles wide.\nAnd Venus slay'th me on that other side\nFor jealousy, and fear of him, Arcite.\"\n\nNow will I stent of Palamon a lite,\nAnd let him in his prison stille dwell,\nAnd of Arcita forth I will you tell.\nThe summer passeth, and the nightes long\nIncrease double-wise the paines strong\nBoth of the lover and the prisonere.\nI n'ot which hath the wofuller mistere.\nFor, shortly for to say, this Palamon\nPerpetually is damned to prison,\nIn chaines and in fetters to be dead;\nAnd Arcite is exiled on his head\nFor evermore as out of that country,\nNor never more he shall his lady see.\nYou lovers ask I now this question,\nWho lieth the worse, Arcite or Palamon?\nThe one may see his lady day by day,\nBut in prison he dwelle must alway.\nThe other where him list may ride or go,\nBut see his lady shall he never mo'.\nNow deem all as you liste, ye that can,\nFor I will tell you forth as I began.\n\nWhen that Arcite to Thebes comen was,\nFull oft a day he swelt, and said, \"Alas!\"\nFor see this lady he shall never mo'.\nAnd shortly to concluden all his woe,\nSo much sorrow had never creature\nThat is or shall be while the world may dure.\nHis sleep, his meat, his drink is him byraft,\nThat lean he wex, and dry as any shaft.\nHis eyen hollow, grisly to behold,\nHis hue sallow, and pale as ashes cold,\nAnd solitary he was, ever alone,\nAnd wailing all the night, making his moan.\nAnd if he hearde song or instrument,\nThen would he weepen, he might not be stent.\nSo feeble were his spirits, and so low,\nAnd changed so, that no man coulde know\nHis speech, neither his voice, though men it heard.\nAnd in his gear for all the world he far'd\nNot only like the lovers' malady\nOf Eros, but rather y-like manie\nEngender'd of humours melancholic,\nBefore his head in his cell fantastic.\nAnd shortly turned was all upside down,\nBoth habit and eke dispositioun,\nOf him, this woful lover Dan Arcite.\nWhy should I all day of his woe indite?\nWhen he endured had a year or two\nThis cruel torment, and this pain and woe,\nAt Thebes, in his country, as I said,\nUpon a night in sleep as he him laid,\nHim thought how that the winged god Mercury\nBefore him stood, and bade him to be merry.\nHis sleepy yard in hand he bare upright;\nA hat he wore upon his haires bright.\nArrayed was this god (as he took keep)\nAs he was when that Argus took his sleep;\nAnd said him thus: \"To Athens shalt thou wend;\nThere is thee shapen of thy woe an end.\"\nAnd with that word Arcite woke and start.\n\"Now truely how sore that e'er me smart,\"\nQuoth he, \"to Athens right now will I fare.\nNor for no dread of death shall I not spare\nTo see my lady that I love and serve;\nIn her presence I recke not to sterve.\"\nAnd with that word he caught a great mirror,\nAnd saw that changed was all his colour,\nAnd saw his visage all in other kind.\nAnd right anon it ran him ill his mind,\nThat since his face was so disfigur'd\nOf malady the which he had endur'd,\nHe mighte well, if that he bare him low,\nLive in Athenes evermore unknow,\nAnd see his lady wellnigh day by day.\nAnd right anon he changed his array,\nAnd clad him as a poore labourer.\nAnd all alone, save only a squier,\nThat knew his privity and all his cas,\nWhich was disguised poorly as he was,\nTo Athens is he gone the nexte way.\nAnd to the court he went upon a day,\nAnd at the gate he proffer'd his service,\nTo drudge and draw, what so men would devise.\nAnd, shortly of this matter for to sayn,\nHe fell in office with a chamberlain,\nThe which that dwelling was with Emily.\nFor he was wise, and coulde soon espy\nOf every servant which that served her.\nWell could he hewe wood, and water bear,\nFor he was young and mighty for the nones,\nAnd thereto he was strong and big of bones\nTo do that any wight can him devise.\n\nA year or two he was in this service,\nPage of the chamber of Emily the bright;\nAnd Philostrate he saide that he hight.\nBut half so well belov'd a man as he\nNe was there never in court of his degree.\nHe was so gentle of conditioun,\nThat throughout all the court was his renown.\nThey saide that it were a charity\nThat Theseus would enhance his degree,\nAnd put him in some worshipful service,\nThere as he might his virtue exercise.\nAnd thus within a while his name sprung\nBoth of his deedes, and of his good tongue,\nThat Theseus hath taken him so near,\nThat of his chamber he hath made him squire,\nAnd gave him gold to maintain his degree;\nAnd eke men brought him out of his country\nFrom year to year full privily his rent.\nBut honestly and slyly he it spent,\nThat no man wonder'd how that he it had.\nAnd three year in this wise his life be lad,\nAnd bare him so in peace and eke in werre,\nThere was no man that Theseus had so derre.\nAnd in this blisse leave I now Arcite,\nAnd speak I will of Palamon a lite.\n\nIn darkness horrible, and strong prison,\nThis seven year hath sitten Palamon,\nForpined, what for love, and for distress.\nWho feeleth double sorrow and heaviness\nBut Palamon? that love distraineth so,\nThat wood out of his wits he went for woe,\nAnd eke thereto he is a prisonere\nPerpetual, not only for a year.\nWho coulde rhyme in English properly\nHis martyrdom? forsooth, it is not I;\nTherefore I pass as lightly as I may.\nIt fell that in the seventh year, in May\nThe thirde night (as olde bookes sayn,\nThat all this story tellen more plain),\nWere it by a venture or destiny\n(As when a thing is shapen it shall be),\nThat soon after the midnight, Palamon\nBy helping of a friend brake his prison,\nAnd fled the city fast as he might go,\nFor he had given drink his gaoler so\nOf a clary , made of a certain wine,\nWith narcotise and opie of Thebes fine,\nThat all the night, though that men would him shake,\nThe gaoler slept, he mighte not awake:\nAnd thus he fled as fast as ever he may.\nThe night was short, and faste by the day\nThat needes cast he must himself to hide.\nAnd to a grove faste there beside\nWith dreadful foot then stalked Palamon.\nFor shortly this was his opinion,\nThat in the grove he would him hide all day,\nAnd in the night then would he take his way\nTo Thebes-ward, his friendes for to pray\nOn Theseus to help him to warray.\nAnd shortly either he would lose his life,\nOr winnen Emily unto his wife.\nThis is th' effect, and his intention plain.\n\nNow will I turn to Arcita again,\nThat little wist how nighe was his care,\nTill that Fortune had brought him in the snare.\nThe busy lark, the messenger of day,\nSaluteth in her song the morning gray;\nAnd fiery Phoebus riseth up so bright,\nThat all the orient laugheth at the sight,\nAnd with his streames drieth in the greves\nThe silver droppes, hanging on the leaves;\nAnd Arcite, that is in the court royal\nWith Theseus, his squier principal,\nIs ris'n, and looketh on the merry day.\nAnd for to do his observance to May,\nRemembering the point of his desire,\nHe on his courser, starting as the fire,\nIs ridden to the fieldes him to play,\nOut of the court, were it a mile or tway.\nAnd to the grove, of which I have you told,\nBy a venture his way began to hold,\nTo make him a garland of the greves,\nWere it of woodbine, or of hawthorn leaves,\nAnd loud he sang against the sun so sheen.\n\"O May, with all thy flowers and thy green,\nRight welcome be thou, faire freshe May,\nI hope that I some green here getten may.\"\nAnd from his courser, with a lusty heart,\nInto the grove full hastily he start,\nAnd in a path he roamed up and down,\nThere as by aventure this Palamon\nWas in a bush, that no man might him see,\nFor sore afeard of his death was he.\nNothing ne knew he that it was Arcite;\nGod wot he would have trowed it full lite.\nBut sooth is said, gone since full many years,\nThe field hath eyen, and the wood hath ears,\nIt is full fair a man to bear him even,\nFor all day meeten men at unset steven.\nFull little wot Arcite of his fellaw,\nThat was so nigh to hearken of his saw,\nFor in the bush he sitteth now full still.\nWhen that Arcite had roamed all his fill,\nAnd sungen all the roundel lustily,\nInto a study he fell suddenly,\nAs do those lovers in their quainte gears,\nNow in the crop, and now down in the breres,\nNow up, now down, as bucket in a well.\nRight as the Friday, soothly for to tell,\nNow shineth it, and now it raineth fast,\nRight so can geary Venus overcast\nThe heartes of her folk, right as her day\nIs gearful, right so changeth she array.\nSeldom is Friday all the weeke like.\nWhen Arcite had y-sung, he gan to sike,\nAnd sat him down withouten any more:\n\"Alas!\" quoth he, \"the day that I was bore!\nHow longe, Juno, through thy cruelty\nWilt thou warrayen Thebes the city?\nAlas! y-brought is to confusion\nThe blood royal of Cadm' and Amphion:\nOf Cadmus, which that was the firste man,\nThat Thebes built, or first the town began,\nAnd of the city first was crowned king.\nOf his lineage am I, and his offspring\nBy very line, as of the stock royal;\nAnd now I am so caitiff and so thrall,\nThat he that is my mortal enemy,\nI serve him as his squier poorely.\nAnd yet doth Juno me well more shame,\nFor I dare not beknow mine owen name,\nBut there as I was wont to hight Arcite,\nNow hight I Philostrate, not worth a mite.\nAlas! thou fell Mars, and alas! Juno,\nThus hath your ire our lineage all fordo\nSave only me, and wretched Palamon,\nThat Theseus martyreth in prison.\nAnd over all this, to slay me utterly,\nLove hath his fiery dart so brenningly\nY-sticked through my true careful heart,\nThat shapen was my death erst than my shert.\nYe slay me with your eyen, Emily;\nYe be the cause wherefore that I die.\nOf all the remnant of mine other care\nNe set I not the mountance of a tare,\nSo that I could do aught to your pleasance.\"\n\nAnd with that word he fell down in a trance\nA longe time; and afterward upstart\nThis Palamon, that thought thorough his heart\nHe felt a cold sword suddenly to glide:\nFor ire he quoke, no longer would he hide.\nAnd when that he had heard Arcite's tale,\nAs he were wood, with face dead and pale,\nHe start him up out of the bushes thick,\nAnd said: \"False Arcita, false traitor wick',\nNow art thou hent, that lov'st my lady so,\nFor whom that I have all this pain and woe,\nAnd art my blood, and to my counsel sworn,\nAs I full oft have told thee herebeforn,\nAnd hast bejaped here Duke Theseus,\nAnd falsely changed hast thy name thus;\nI will be dead, or elles thou shalt die.\nThou shalt not love my lady Emily,\nBut I will love her only and no mo';\nFor I am Palamon thy mortal foe.\nAnd though I have no weapon in this place,\nBut out of prison am astart by grace,\nI dreade not that either thou shalt die,\nOr else thou shalt not loven Emily.\nChoose which thou wilt, for thou shalt not astart.\"\n\nThis Arcite then, with full dispiteous heart,\nWhen he him knew, and had his tale heard,\nAs fierce as lion pulled out a swerd,\nAnd saide thus; \"By God that sitt'th above,\nN'ere it that thou art sick, and wood for love,\nAnd eke that thou no weap'n hast in this place,\nThou should'st never out of this grove pace,\nThat thou ne shouldest dien of mine hand.\nFor I defy the surety and the band,\nWhich that thou sayest I have made to thee.\nWhat? very fool, think well that love is free;\nAnd I will love her maugre all thy might.\nBut, for thou art a worthy gentle knight,\nAnd wilnest to darraine her by bataille,\nHave here my troth, to-morrow I will not fail,\nWithout weeting of any other wight,\nThat here I will be founden as a knight,\nAnd bringe harness right enough for thee;\nAnd choose the best, and leave the worst for me.\nAnd meat and drinke this night will I bring\nEnough for thee, and clothes for thy bedding.\nAnd if so be that thou my lady win,\nAnd slay me in this wood that I am in,\nThou may'st well have thy lady as for me.\"\nThis Palamon answer'd, \"I grant it thee.\"\nAnd thus they be departed till the morrow,\nWhen each of them hath laid his faith to borrow.\n\nO Cupid, out of alle charity!\nO Regne that wilt no fellow have with thee!\nFull sooth is said, that love nor lordeship\nWill not, his thanks, have any fellowship.\nWell finden that Arcite and Palamon.\nArcite is ridd anon unto the town,\nAnd on the morrow, ere it were daylight,\nFull privily two harness hath he dight,\nBoth suffisant and meete to darraine\nThe battle in the field betwixt them twain.\nAnd on his horse, alone as he was born,\nHe carrieth all this harness him beforn;\nAnd in the grove, at time and place y-set,\nThis Arcite and this Palamon be met.\nThen change gan the colour of their face;\nRight as the hunter in the regne of Thrace\nThat standeth at a gappe with a spear\nWhen hunted is the lion or the bear,\nAnd heareth him come rushing in the greves,\nAnd breaking both the boughes and the leaves,\nThinketh, \"Here comes my mortal enemy,\nWithoute fail, he must be dead or I;\nFor either I must slay him at the gap;\nOr he must slay me, if that me mishap:\"\nSo fared they, in changing of their hue\nAs far as either of them other knew.\nThere was no good day, and no saluting,\nBut straight, withoute wordes rehearsing,\nEvereach of them holp to arm the other,\nAs friendly, as he were his owen brother.\nAnd after that, with sharpe speares strong\nThey foined each at other wonder long.\nThou mightest weene, that this Palamon\nIn fighting were as a wood lion,\nAnd as a cruel tiger was Arcite:\nAs wilde boars gan they together smite,\nThat froth as white as foam, for ire wood.\nUp to the ancle fought they in their blood.\nAnd in this wise I let them fighting dwell,\nAnd forth I will of Theseus you tell.\n\nThe Destiny, minister general,\nThat executeth in the world o'er all\nThe purveyance, that God hath seen beforn;\nSo strong it is, that though the world had sworn\nThe contrary of a thing by yea or nay,\nYet some time it shall fallen on a day\nThat falleth not eft in a thousand year.\nFor certainly our appetites here,\nBe it of war, or peace, or hate, or love,\nAll is this ruled by the sight above.\nThis mean I now by mighty Theseus,\nThat for to hunten is so desirous --\nAnd namely the greate hart in May --\nThat in his bed there dawneth him no day\nThat he n'is clad, and ready for to ride\nWith hunt and horn, and houndes him beside.\nFor in his hunting hath he such delight,\nThat it is all his joy and appetite\nTo be himself the greate harte's bane\nFor after Mars he serveth now Diane.\nClear was the day, as I have told ere this,\nAnd Theseus, with alle joy and bliss,\nWith his Hippolyta, the faire queen,\nAnd Emily, y-clothed all in green,\nOn hunting be they ridden royally.\nAnd to the grove, that stood there faste by,\nIn which there was an hart, as men him told,\nDuke Theseus the straighte way doth hold,\nAnd to the laund he rideth him full right,\nThere was the hart y-wont to have his flight,\nAnd over a brook, and so forth on his way.\nThis Duke will have a course at him or tway\nWith houndes, such as him lust to command.\nAnd when this Duke was come to the laund,\nUnder the sun he looked, and anon\nHe was ware of Arcite and Palamon,\nThat foughte breme, as it were bulles two.\nThe brighte swordes wente to and fro\nSo hideously, that with the leaste stroke\nIt seemed that it woulde fell an oak,\nBut what they were, nothing yet he wote.\nThis Duke his courser with his spurres smote,\nAnd at a start he was betwixt them two,\nAnd pulled out a sword and cried, \"Ho!\nNo more, on pain of losing of your head.\nBy mighty Mars, he shall anon be dead\nThat smiteth any stroke, that I may see!\nBut tell to me what mister men ye be,\nThat be so hardy for to fighte here\nWithoute judge or other officer,\nAs though it were in listes royally.\nThis Palamon answered hastily,\nAnd saide: \"Sir, what needeth wordes mo'?\nWe have the death deserved bothe two,\nTwo woful wretches be we, and caitives,\nThat be accumbered of our own lives,\nAnd as thou art a rightful lord and judge,\nSo give us neither mercy nor refuge.\nAnd slay me first, for sainte charity,\nBut slay my fellow eke as well as me.\nOr slay him first; for, though thou know it lite,\nThis is thy mortal foe, this is Arcite\nThat from thy land is banisht on his head,\nFor which he hath deserved to be dead.\nFor this is he that came unto thy gate\nAnd saide, that he highte Philostrate.\nThus hath he japed thee full many year,\nAnd thou hast made of him thy chief esquier;\nAnd this is he, that loveth Emily.\nFor since the day is come that I shall die\nI make pleinly my confession,\nThat I am thilke woful Palamon,\nThat hath thy prison broken wickedly.\nI am thy mortal foe, and it am I\nThat so hot loveth Emily the bright,\nThat I would die here present in her sight.\nTherefore I aske death and my jewise.\nBut slay my fellow eke in the same wise,\nFor both we have deserved to be slain.\"\n\nThis worthy Duke answer'd anon again,\nAnd said, \"This is a short conclusion.\nYour own mouth, by your own confession\nHath damned you, and I will it record;\nIt needeth not to pain you with the cord;\nYe shall be dead, by mighty Mars the Red.\n\nThe queen anon for very womanhead\nBegan to weep, and so did Emily,\nAnd all the ladies in the company.\nGreat pity was it as it thought them all,\nThat ever such a chance should befall,\nFor gentle men they were, of great estate,\nAnd nothing but for love was this debate\nThey saw their bloody woundes wide and sore,\nAnd cried all at once, both less and more,\n\"Have mercy, Lord, upon us women all.\"\nAnd on their bare knees adown they fall\nAnd would have kissed his feet there as he stood,\nTill at the last aslaked was his mood\n(For pity runneth soon in gentle heart);\nAnd though at first for ire he quoke and start\nHe hath consider'd shortly in a clause\nThe trespass of them both, and eke the cause:\nAnd although that his ire their guilt accused\nYet in his reason he them both excused;\nAs thus; he thoughte well that every man\nWill help himself in love if that he can,\nAnd eke deliver himself out of prison.\nOf women, for they wepten ever-in-one:\nAnd eke his hearte had compassion\nAnd in his gentle heart he thought anon,\nAnd soft unto himself he saide: \"Fie\nUpon a lord that will have no mercy,\nBut be a lion both in word and deed,\nTo them that be in repentance and dread,\nAs well as-to a proud dispiteous man\nThat will maintaine what he first began.\nThat lord hath little of discretion,\nThat in such case can no division:\nBut weigheth pride and humbless after one.\"\nAnd shortly, when his ire is thus agone,\nHe gan to look on them with eyen light,\nAnd spake these same wordes all on height.\n\n\"The god of love, ah! benedicite,\nHow mighty and how great a lord is he!\nAgainst his might there gaine none obstacles,\nHe may be called a god for his miracles\nFor he can maken at his owen guise\nOf every heart, as that him list devise.\nLo here this Arcite, and this Palamon,\nThat quietly were out of my prison,\nAnd might have lived in Thebes royally,\nAnd weet I am their mortal enemy,\nAnd that their death li'th in my might also,\nAnd yet hath love, maugre their eyen two,\nY-brought them hither bothe for to die.\nNow look ye, is not this an high folly?\nWho may not be a fool, if but he love?\nBehold, for Godde's sake that sits above,\nSee how they bleed! be they not well array'd?\nThus hath their lord, the god of love, them paid\nTheir wages and their fees for their service;\nAnd yet they weene for to be full wise,\nThat serve love, for aught that may befall.\nBut this is yet the beste game of all,\nThat she, for whom they have this jealousy,\nCan them therefor as muchel thank as me.\nShe wot no more of all this hote fare,\nBy God, than wot a cuckoo or an hare.\nBut all must be assayed hot or cold;\nA man must be a fool, or young or old;\nI wot it by myself full yore agone:\nFor in my time a servant was I one.\nAnd therefore since I know of love's pain,\nAnd wot how sore it can a man distrain,\nAs he that oft hath been caught in his last,\nI you forgive wholly this trespass,\nAt request of the queen that kneeleth here,\nAnd eke of Emily, my sister dear.\nAnd ye shall both anon unto me swear,\nThat never more ye shall my country dere\nNor make war upon me night nor day,\nBut be my friends in alle that ye may.\nI you forgive this trespass every deal.\nAnd they him sware his asking fair and well,\nAnd him of lordship and of mercy pray'd,\nAnd he them granted grace, and thus he said:\n\n\"To speak of royal lineage and richess,\nThough that she were a queen or a princess,\nEach of you both is worthy doubteless\nTo wedde when time is; but natheless\nI speak as for my sister Emily,\nFor whom ye have this strife and jealousy,\nYe wot yourselves, she may not wed the two\nAt once, although ye fight for evermo:\nBut one of you, all be him loth or lief,\nHe must go pipe into an ivy leaf:\nThis is to say, she may not have you both,\nAll be ye never so jealous, nor so wroth.\nAnd therefore I you put in this degree,\nThat each of you shall have his destiny\nAs him is shape; and hearken in what wise\nLo hear your end of that I shall devise.\nMy will is this, for plain conclusion\nWithouten any replication,\nIf that you liketh, take it for the best,\nThat evereach of you shall go where him lest,\nFreely without ransom or danger;\nAnd this day fifty weekes, farre ne nerre,\nEvereach of you shall bring an hundred knights,\nArmed for listes up at alle rights\nAll ready to darraine her by bataille,\nAnd this behete I you withoute fail\nUpon my troth, and as I am a knight,\nThat whether of you bothe that hath might,\nThat is to say, that whether he or thou\nMay with his hundred, as I spake of now,\nSlay his contrary, or out of listes drive,\nHim shall I given Emily to wive,\nTo whom that fortune gives so fair a grace.\nThe listes shall I make here in this place.\nAnd God so wisly on my soule rue,\nAs I shall even judge be and true.\nYe shall none other ende with me maken\nThan one of you shalle be dead or taken.\nAnd if you thinketh this is well y-said,\nSay your advice, and hold yourselves apaid.\nThis is your end, and your conclusion.\"\nWho looketh lightly now but Palamon?\nWho springeth up for joye but Arcite?\nWho could it tell, or who could it indite,\nThe joye that is maked in the place\nWhen Theseus hath done so fair a grace?\nBut down on knees went every manner wight,\nAnd thanked him with all their heartes' might,\nAnd namely these Thebans ofte sithe.\nAnd thus with good hope and with hearte blithe\nThey take their leave, and homeward gan they ride\nTo Thebes-ward, with his old walles wide.\n\nI trow men woulde deem it negligence,\nIf I forgot to telle the dispence\nOf Theseus, that went so busily\nTo maken up the listes royally,\nThat such a noble theatre as it was,\nI dare well say, in all this world there n'as.\nThe circuit a mile was about,\nWalled of stone, and ditched all without.\nRound was the shape, in manner of compass,\nFull of degrees, the height of sixty pas\nThat when a man was set on one degree\nHe letted not his fellow for to see.\nEastward there stood a gate of marble white,\nWestward right such another opposite.\nAnd, shortly to conclude, such a place\nWas never on earth made in so little space,\nFor in the land there was no craftes-man,\nThat geometry or arsmetrike can,\nNor pourtrayor, nor carver of images,\nThat Theseus ne gave him meat and wages\nThe theatre to make and to devise.\nAnd for to do his rite and sacrifice\nHe eastward hath upon the gate above,\nIn worship of Venus, goddess of love,\nDone make an altar and an oratory;\nAnd westward, in the mind and in memory\nOf Mars, he maked hath right such another,\nThat coste largely of gold a fother.\nAnd northward, in a turret on the wall,\nOf alabaster white and red coral\nAn oratory riche for to see,\nIn worship of Diane of chastity,\nHath Theseus done work in noble wise.\nBut yet had I forgotten to devise\nThe noble carving, and the portraitures,\nThe shape, the countenance of the figures\nThat weren in there oratories three.\n\nFirst in the temple of Venus may'st thou see\nWrought on the wall,  full piteous to behold,\nThe broken sleepes, and the sikes cold,\nThe sacred teares, and the waimentings,\nThe fiery strokes of the desirings,\nThat Love's servants in this life endure;\nThe oathes, that their covenants assure.\nPleasance and Hope, Desire, Foolhardiness,\nBeauty and Youth, and Bawdry and Richess,\nCharms and Sorc'ry, Leasings and Flattery,\nDispence, Business, and Jealousy,\nThat wore of yellow goldes a garland,\nAnd had a cuckoo sitting on her hand,\nFeasts, instruments, and caroles and dances,\nLust and array, and all the circumstances\nOf Love, which I reckon'd and reckon shall\nIn order, were painted on the wall,\nAnd more than I can make of mention.\nFor soothly all the mount of Citheron,\nWhere Venus hath her principal dwelling,\nWas showed on the wall in pourtraying,\nWith all the garden, and the lustiness.\nNor was forgot the porter Idleness,\nNor Narcissus the fair of yore agone,\nNor yet the folly of King Solomon,\nNor yet the greate strength of Hercules,\nTh' enchantments of Medea and Circes,\nNor of Turnus the hardy fierce courage,\nThe rich Croesus caitif in servage.\nThus may ye see, that wisdom nor richess,\nBeauty, nor sleight, nor strength, nor hardiness\nNe may with Venus holde champartie,\nFor as her liste the world may she gie.\nLo, all these folk so caught were in her las\nTill they for woe full often said, Alas!\nSuffice these ensamples one or two,\nAlthough I could reckon a thousand mo'.\n\nThe statue of Venus, glorious to see\nWas naked floating in the large sea,\nAnd from the navel down all cover'd was\nWith waves green, and bright as any glass.\nA citole  in her right hand hadde she,\nAnd on her head, full seemly for to see,\nA rose garland fresh, and well smelling,\nAbove her head her doves flickering\nBefore her stood her sone Cupido,\nUpon his shoulders winges had he two;\nAnd blind he was, as it is often seen;\nA bow he bare, and arrows bright and keen.\n\nWhy should I not as well eke tell you all\nThe portraiture, that was upon the wall\nWithin the temple of mighty Mars the Red?\nAll painted was the wall in length and brede\nLike to the estres of the grisly place\nThat hight the great temple of Mars in Thrace,\nIn thilke cold and frosty region,\nThere as Mars hath his sovereign mansion.\nIn which there dwelled neither man nor beast,\nWith knotty gnarry barren trees old\nOf stubbes sharp and hideous to behold;\nIn which there ran a rumble and a sough,\nAs though a storm should bursten every bough:\nAnd downward from an hill under a bent\nThere stood the temple of Mars Armipotent,\nWrought all of burnish'd steel, of which th' entry\nWas long and strait, and ghastly for to see.\nAnd thereout came a rage and such a vise,\nThat it made all the gates for to rise.\nThe northern light in at the doore shone,\nFor window on the walle was there none\nThrough which men mighten any light discern.\nThe doors were all of adamant etern,\nY-clenched overthwart and ende-long\nWith iron tough, and, for to make it strong,\nEvery pillar the temple to sustain\nWas tunne-great, of iron bright and sheen.\nThere saw I first the dark imagining\nOf felony, and all the compassing;\nThe cruel ire, as red as any glede,\nThe picke-purse, and eke the pale dread;\nThe smiler with the knife under the cloak,\nThe shepen burning with the blacke smoke\nThe treason of the murd'ring in the bed,\nThe open war, with woundes all be-bled;\nConteke with bloody knife, and sharp menace.\nAll full of chirking was that sorry place.\nThe slayer of himself eke saw I there,\nHis hearte-blood had bathed all his hair:\nThe nail y-driven in the shode at night,\nThe colde death, with mouth gaping upright.\nAmiddes of the temple sat Mischance,\nWith discomfort and sorry countenance;\nEke saw I Woodness laughing in his rage,\nArmed Complaint, Outhees, and fierce Outrage;\nThe carrain in the bush, with throat y-corve,\nA thousand slain, and not of qualm y-storve;\nThe tyrant, with the prey by force y-reft;\nThe town destroy'd, that there was nothing left.\nYet saw I brent the shippes hoppesteres,\nThe hunter strangled with the wilde bears:\nThe sow freting the child right in the cradle;\nThe cook scalded, for all his longe ladle.\nNor was forgot, by th'infortune of Mart\nThe carter overridden with his cart;\nUnder the wheel full low he lay adown.\nThere were also of Mars' division,\nThe armourer, the bowyer, and the smith,\nThat forgeth sharp swordes on his stith.\nAnd all above depainted in a tower\nSaw I Conquest, sitting in great honour,\nWith thilke sharpe sword over his head\nHanging by a subtle y-twined thread.\nPainted the slaughter was of Julius,\nOf cruel Nero, and Antonius:\nAlthough at that time they were yet unborn,\nYet was their death depainted there beforn,\nBy menacing of Mars, right by figure,\nSo was it showed in that portraiture,\nAs is depainted in the stars above,\nWho shall be slain, or elles dead for love.\nSufficeth one ensample in stories old,\nI may not reckon them all, though I wo'ld.\n\nThe statue of Mars upon a carte stood\nArmed, and looked grim as he were wood,\nAnd over his head there shone two figures\nOf starres, that be cleped in scriptures,\nThat one Puella, that other Rubeus.\nThis god of armes was arrayed thus:\nA wolf there stood before him at his feet\nWith eyen red, and of a man he eat:\nWith subtle pencil painted was this story,\nIn redouting of Mars and of his glory.\n\nNow to the temple of Dian the chaste\nAs shortly as I can I will me haste,\nTo telle you all the descriptioun.\nDepainted be the walles up and down\nOf hunting and of shamefast chastity.\nThere saw I how woful Calistope,\nWhen that Dian aggrieved was with her,\nWas turned from a woman to a bear,\nAnd after was she made the lodestar:\nThus was it painted, I can say no far;\nHer son is eke a star as men may see.\nThere saw I Dane  turn'd into a tree,\nI meane not the goddess Diane,\nBut Peneus' daughter, which that hight Dane.\nThere saw I Actaeon an hart y-maked,\nFor vengeance that he saw Dian all naked:\nI saw how that his houndes have him caught,\nAnd freten him, for that they knew him not.\nYet painted was, a little farthermore\nHow Atalanta hunted the wild boar;\nAnd Meleager, and many other mo',\nFor which Diana wrought them care and woe.\nThere saw I many another wondrous story,\nThe which me list not drawen to memory.\nThis goddess on an hart full high was set,\nWith smalle houndes all about her feet,\nAnd underneath her feet she had a moon,\nWaxing it was, and shoulde wane soon.\nIn gaudy green her statue clothed was,\nWith bow in hand, and arrows in a case.\nHer eyen caste she full low adown,\nWhere Pluto hath his darke regioun.\nA woman travailing was her beforn,\nBut, for her child so longe was unborn,\nFull piteously Lucina  gan she call,\nAnd saide; \"Help, for thou may'st best of all.\"\nWell could he painte lifelike that it wrought;\nWith many a florin he the hues had bought.\nNow be these listes made, and Theseus,\nThat at his greate cost arrayed thus\nThe temples, and the theatre every deal,\nWhen it was done, him liked wonder well.\n\nBut stint I will of Theseus a lite,\nAnd speak of Palamon and of Arcite.\nThe day approacheth of their returning,\nThat evereach an hundred knights should bring,\nThe battle to darraine as I you told;\nAnd to Athens, their covenant to hold,\nHath ev'reach of them brought an hundred knights,\nWell-armed for the war at alle rights.\nAnd sickerly there trowed many a man,\nThat never, sithen that the world began,\nFor to speaken of knighthood of their hand,\nAs far as God hath maked sea and land,\nWas, of so few, so noble a company.\nFor every wight that loved chivalry,\nAnd would, his thankes, have a passant name,\nHad prayed, that he might be of that game,\nAnd well was him, that thereto chosen was.\nFor if there fell to-morrow such a case,\nYe knowe well, that every lusty knight,\nThat loveth par amour, and hath his might\nWere it in Engleland, or elleswhere,\nThey would, their thankes, willen to be there,\nT' fight for a lady; Benedicite,\nIt were a lusty sighte for to see.\nAnd right so fared they with Palamon;\nWith him there wente knightes many one.\nSome will be armed in an habergeon,\nAnd in a breast-plate, and in a gipon;\nAnd some will have a pair of plates large;\nAnd some will have a Prusse shield, or targe;\nSome will be armed on their legges weel;\nSome have an axe, and some a mace of steel.\nThere is no newe guise, but it was old.\nArmed they weren, as I have you told,\nEvereach after his opinion.\nThere may'st thou see coming with Palamon\nLicurgus himself, the great king of Thrace:\nBlack was his beard, and manly was his face.\nThe circles of his eyen in his head\nThey glowed betwixte yellow and red,\nAnd like a griffin looked he about,\nWith kemped haires on his browes stout;\nHis limbs were great, his brawns were hard and strong,\nHis shoulders broad, his armes round and long.\nAnd as the guise was in his country,\nFull high upon a car of gold stood he,\nWith foure white bulles in the trace.\nInstead of coat-armour on his harness,\nWith yellow nails, and bright as any gold,\nHe had a beare's skin, coal-black for old.\nHis long hair was y-kempt behind his back,\nAs any raven's feather it shone for black.\nA wreath of gold arm-great, of huge weight,\nUpon his head sate, full of stones bright,\nOf fine rubies and clear diamants.\nAbout his car there wente white alauns,\nTwenty and more, as great as any steer,\nTo hunt the lion or the wilde bear,\nAnd follow'd him, with muzzle fast y-bound,\nCollars of gold, and torettes filed round.\nAn hundred lordes had he in his rout\nArmed full well, with heartes stern and stout.\n\nWith Arcita, in stories as men find,\nThe great Emetrius the king of Ind,\nUpon a steede bay trapped in steel,\nCover'd with cloth of gold diapred well,\nCame riding like the god of armes, Mars.\nHis coat-armour was of a cloth of Tars,\nCouched with pearls white and round and great\nHis saddle was of burnish'd gold new beat;\nA mantelet on his shoulders hanging,\nBretful of rubies red, as fire sparkling.\nHis crispe hair like ringes was y-run,\nAnd that was yellow, glittering as the sun.\nHis nose was high, his eyen bright citrine,\nHis lips were round, his colour was sanguine,\nA fewe fracknes in his face y-sprent,\nBetwixte yellow and black somedeal y-ment\nAnd as a lion he his looking cast\nOf five and twenty year his age I cast\nHis beard was well begunnen for to spring;\nHis voice was as a trumpet thundering.\nUpon his head he wore of laurel green\nA garland fresh and lusty to be seen;\nUpon his hand he bare, for his delight,\nAn eagle tame, as any lily white.\nAn hundred lordes had he with him there,\nAll armed, save their heads, in all their gear,\nFull richely in alle manner things.\nFor trust ye well, that earles, dukes, and kings\nWere gather'd in this noble company,\nFor love, and for increase of chivalry.\nAbout this king there ran on every part\nFull many a tame lion and leopart.\nAnd in this wise these lordes all and some\nBe on the Sunday to the city come\nAboute prime, and in the town alight.\n\nThis Theseus, this Duke, this worthy knight\nWhen he had brought them into his city,\nAnd inned them, ev'reach at his degree,\nHe feasteth them, and doth so great labour\nTo easen them, and do them all honour,\nThat yet men weene that no mannes wit\nOf none estate could amenden it.\nThe minstrelsy, the service at the feast,\nThe greate giftes to the most and least,\nThe rich array of Theseus' palace,\nNor who sate first or last upon the dais.\nWhat ladies fairest be, or best dancing\nOr which of them can carol best or sing,\nOr who most feelingly speaketh of love;\nWhat hawkes sitten on the perch above,\nWhat houndes liggen on the floor adown,\nOf all this now make I no mentioun\nBut of th'effect; that thinketh me the best\nNow comes the point, and hearken if you lest.\n\nThe Sunday night, ere day began to spring,\nWhen Palamon the larke hearde sing,\nAlthough it were not day by houres two,\nYet sang the lark, and Palamon right tho\nWith holy heart, and with an high courage,\nArose, to wenden on his pilgrimage\nUnto the blissful Cithera benign,\nI meane Venus, honourable and digne.\nAnd in her hour  he walketh forth a pace\nUnto the listes, where her temple was,\nAnd down he kneeleth, and with humble cheer\nAnd hearte sore, he said as ye shall hear.\n\n\"Fairest of fair, O lady mine Venus,\nDaughter to Jove, and spouse of Vulcanus,\nThou gladder of the mount of Citheron!\nFor thilke love thou haddest to Adon\nHave pity on my bitter teares smart,\nAnd take mine humble prayer to thine heart.\nAlas! I have no language to tell\nTh'effecte, nor the torment of mine hell;\nMine hearte may mine harmes not betray;\nI am so confused, that I cannot say.\nBut mercy, lady bright, that knowest well\nMy thought, and seest what harm that I feel.\nConsider all this, and rue upon my sore,\nAs wisly as I shall for evermore\nEnforce my might, thy true servant to be,\nAnd holde war alway with chastity:\nThat make I mine avow, so ye me help.\nI keepe not of armes for to yelp,\nNor ask I not to-morrow to have victory,\nNor renown in this case, nor vaine glory\nOf prize of armes, blowing up and down,\nBut I would have fully possessioun\nOf Emily, and die in her service;\nFind thou the manner how, and in what wise.\nI recke not but it may better be\nTo have vict'ry of them, or they of me,\nSo that I have my lady in mine arms.\nFor though so be that Mars is god of arms,\nYour virtue is so great in heaven above,\nThat, if you list, I shall well have my love.\nThy temple will I worship evermo',\nAnd on thine altar, where I ride or go,\nI will do sacrifice, and fires bete.\nAnd if ye will not so, my lady sweet,\nThen pray I you, to-morrow with a spear\nThat Arcita me through the hearte bear\nThen reck I not, when I have lost my life,\nThough that Arcita win her to his wife.\nThis is th' effect and end of my prayere, --\nGive me my love, thou blissful lady dear.\"\nWhen th' orison was done of Palamon,\nHis sacrifice he did, and that anon,\nFull piteously, with alle circumstances,\nAll tell I not as now his observances.\nBut at the last the statue of Venus shook,\nAnd made a signe, whereby that he took\nThat his prayer accepted was that day.\nFor though the signe shewed a delay,\nYet wist he well that granted was his boon;\nAnd with glad heart he went him home full soon.\n\nThe third hour unequal   that Palamon\nBegan to Venus' temple for to gon,\nUp rose the sun, and up rose Emily,\nAnd to the temple of Dian gan hie.\nHer maidens, that she thither with her lad,\nTh' incense, the clothes, and the remnant all\nThat to the sacrifice belonge shall,\nThe hornes full of mead, as was the guise;\nThere lacked nought to do her sacrifice.\nSmoking the temple full of clothes fair,\nThis Emily with hearte debonnair\nHer body wash'd with water of a well.\nBut how she did her rite I dare not tell;\nBut it be any thing in general;\nAnd yet it were a game to hearen all\nTo him that meaneth well it were no charge:\nBut it is good a man to be at large.\nHer bright hair combed was, untressed all.\nA coronet of green oak cerriall\nUpon her head was set full fair and meet.\nTwo fires on the altar gan she bete,\nAnd did her thinges, as men may behold\nIn Stace of Thebes , and these bookes old.\nWhen kindled was the fire, with piteous cheer\nUnto Dian she spake as ye may hear.\n\n\"O chaste goddess of the woodes green,\nTo whom both heav'n and earth and sea is seen,\nQueen of the realm of Pluto dark and low,\nGoddess of maidens, that mine heart hast know\nFull many a year, and wost what I desire,\nTo keep me from the vengeance of thine ire,\nThat Actaeon aboughte cruelly:\nChaste goddess, well wottest thou that I\nDesire to be a maiden all my life,\nNor never will I be no love nor wife.\nI am, thou wost, yet of thy company,\nA maid, and love hunting and venery,\nAnd for to walken in the woodes wild,\nAnd not to be a wife, and be with child.\nNought will I know the company of man.\nNow help me, lady, since ye may and can,\nFor those three formes  that thou hast in thee.\nAnd Palamon, that hath such love to me,\nAnd eke Arcite, that loveth me so sore,\nThis grace I pray thee withoute more,\nAs sende love and peace betwixt them two:\nAnd from me turn away their heartes so,\nThat all their hote love, and their desire,\nAnd all their busy torment, and their fire,\nBe queint, or turn'd into another place.\nAnd if so be thou wilt do me no grace,\nOr if my destiny be shapen so\nThat I shall needes have one of them two,\nSo send me him that most desireth me.\nBehold, goddess of cleane chastity,\nThe bitter tears that on my cheekes fall.\nSince thou art maid, and keeper of us all,\nMy maidenhead thou keep and well conserve,\nAnd, while I live, a maid I will thee serve.\n\nThe fires burn upon the altar clear,\nWhile Emily was thus in her prayere:\nBut suddenly she saw a sighte quaint.\nFor right anon one of the fire's queint\nAnd quick'd again, and after that anon\nThat other fire was queint, and all agone:\nAnd as it queint, it made a whisteling,\nAs doth a brande wet in its burning.\nAnd at the brandes end outran anon\nAs it were bloody droppes many one:\nFor which so sore aghast was Emily,\nThat she was well-nigh mad, and gan to cry,\nFor she ne wiste what it signified;\nBut onely for feare thus she cried,\nAnd wept, that it was pity for to hear.\nAnd therewithal Diana gan appear\nWith bow in hand, right as an hunteress,\nAnd saide; \"Daughter, stint thine heaviness.\nAmong the goddes high it is affirm'd,\nAnd by eternal word writ and confirm'd,\nThou shalt be wedded unto one of tho\nThat have for thee so muche care and woe:\nBut unto which of them I may not tell.\nFarewell, for here I may no longer dwell.\nThe fires which that on mine altar brenn,\nShall thee declaren, ere that thou go henne,\nThine aventure of love, as in this case.\"\nAnd with that word, the arrows in the case\nOf the goddess did clatter fast and ring,\nAnd forth she went, and made a vanishing,\nFor which this Emily astonied was,\nAnd saide; \"What amounteth this, alas!\nI put me under thy protection,\nDiane, and in thy disposition.\"\nAnd home she went anon the nexte way.\nThis is th' effect, there is no more to say.\n\nThe nexte hour of Mars following this\nArcite to the temple walked is\nOf fierce Mars, to do his sacrifice\nWith all the rites of his pagan guise.\nWith piteous heart and high devotion\nRight thus to Mars he said his orison\n\"O stronge god, that in the regnes old\nOf Thrace honoured art, and lord y-hold\nAnd hast in every regne, and every land\nOf armes all the bridle in thine hand,\nAnd them fortunest as thee list devise,\nAccept of me my piteous sacrifice.\nIf so be that my youthe may deserve,\nAnd that my might be worthy for to serve\nThy godhead, that I may be one of thine,\nThen pray I thee to rue upon my pine,\nFor thilke pain, and thilke hote fire,\nIn which thou whilom burned'st for desire\nWhenne that thou usedest the beauty\nOf faire young Venus, fresh and free,\nAnd haddest her in armes at thy will:\nAnd though thee ones on a time misfill,\nWhen Vulcanus had caught thee in his las,\nAnd found thee ligging by his wife, alas!\nFor thilke sorrow that was in thine heart,\nHave ruth as well upon my paine's smart.\nI am young and unconning, as thou know'st,\nAnd, as I trow, with love offended most\nThat e'er was any living creature:\nFor she, that doth me all this woe endure,\nNe recketh ne'er whether I sink or fleet\nAnd well I wot, ere she me mercy hete,\nI must with strengthe win her in the place:\nAnd well I wot, withoute help or grace\nOf thee, ne may my strengthe not avail:\nThen help me, lord, to-morr'w in my bataille,\nFor thilke fire that whilom burned thee,\nAs well as this fire that now burneth me;\nAnd do that I to-morr'w may have victory.\nMine be the travail, all thine be the glory.\nThy sovereign temple will I most honour\nOf any place, and alway most labour\nIn thy pleasance and in thy craftes strong.\nAnd in thy temple I will my banner hong,\nAnd all the armes of my company,\nAnd evermore, until that day I die,\nEternal fire I will before thee find\nAnd eke to this my vow I will me bind:\nMy beard, my hair that hangeth long adown,\nThat never yet hath felt offension\nOf razor nor of shears, I will thee give,\nAnd be thy true servant while I live.\nNow, lord, have ruth upon my sorrows sore,\nGive me the victory, I ask no more.\"\n\nThe prayer stint of Arcita the strong,\nThe ringes on the temple door that hong,\nAnd eke the doores, clattered full fast,\nOf which Arcita somewhat was aghast.\nThe fires burn'd upon the altar bright,\nThat it gan all the temple for to light;\nA sweete smell anon the ground up gaf,\nAnd Arcita anon his hand up haf,\nAnd more incense into the fire he cast,\nWith other rites more and at the last\nThe statue of Mars began his hauberk ring;\nAnd with that sound he heard a murmuring\nFull low and dim, that saide thus,  \"Victory.\"\nFor which he gave to Mars honour and glory.\nAnd thus with joy, and hope well to fare,\nArcite anon unto his inn doth fare.\nAs fain as fowl is of the brighte sun.\n\nAnd right anon such strife there is begun\nFor thilke granting, in the heav'n above,\nBetwixte Venus the goddess of love,\nAnd Mars the sterne god armipotent,\nThat Jupiter was busy it to stent:\nTill that the pale Saturnus the cold,\nThat knew so many of adventures old,\nFound in his old experience such an art,\nThat he full soon hath pleased every part.\nAs sooth is said, eld hath great advantage,\nIn eld is bothe wisdom and usage:\nMen may the old out-run, but not out-rede.\nSaturn anon, to stint the strife and drede,\nAlbeit that it is against his kind,\nOf all this strife gan a remedy find.\n\"My deare daughter Venus,\" quoth Saturn,\n\"My course, that hath so wide for to turn,\nHath more power than wot any man.\nMine is the drowning in the sea so wan;\nMine is the prison in the darke cote,\nMine the strangling and hanging by the throat,\nThe murmur, and the churlish rebelling,\nThe groyning, and the privy poisoning.\nI do vengeance and plein correction,\nI dwell in the sign of the lion.\nMine is the ruin of the highe halls,\nThe falling of the towers and the walls\nUpon the miner or the carpenter:\nI slew Samson in shaking the pillar:\nMine also be the maladies cold,\nThe darke treasons, and the castes old:\nMy looking is the father of pestilence.\nNow weep no more, I shall do diligence\nThat Palamon, that is thine owen knight,\nShall have his lady, as thou hast him hight.\nThough Mars shall help his knight, yet natheless\nBetwixte you there must sometime be peace:\nAll be ye not of one complexion,\nThat each day causeth such division,\nI am thine ayel, ready at thy will;\nWeep now no more, I shall thy lust fulfil.\"\nNow will I stenten of the gods above,\nOf Mars, and of Venus, goddess of love,\nAnd telle you as plainly as I can\nThe great effect, for which that I began.\n\nGreat was the feast in Athens thilke day;\nAnd eke the lusty season of that May\nMade every wight to be in such pleasance,\nThat all that Monday jousten they and dance,\nAnd spenden it in Venus' high service.\nBut by the cause that they shoulde rise\nEarly a-morrow for to see that fight,\nUnto their reste wente they at night.\nAnd on the morrow, when the day gan spring,\nOf horse and harness noise and clattering\nThere was in the hostelries all about:\nAnd to the palace rode there many a rout\nOf lordes, upon steedes and palfreys.\nThere mayst thou see devising of harness\nSo uncouth and so rich, and wrought so weel\nOf goldsmithry, of brouding, and of steel;\nThe shieldes bright, the testers, and trappures\nGold-hewen helmets, hauberks, coat-armures;\nLordes in parements on their coursers,\nKnightes of retinue, and eke squiers,\nNailing the spears, and helmes buckeling,\nGniding of shieldes, with lainers lacing;\nThere as need is, they were nothing idle:\nThe foamy steeds upon the golden bridle\nGnawing, and fast the armourers also\nWith file and hammer pricking to and fro;\nYeomen on foot, and knaves many one\nWith shorte staves, thick as they may gon;\nPipes, trumpets, nakeres, and clariouns,\nThat in the battle blowe bloody souns;\nThe palace full of people up and down,\nThere three, there ten, holding their questioun,\nDivining of these Theban knightes two.\nSome saiden thus, some said it shall he so;\nSome helden with him with the blacke beard,\nSome with the bald, some with the thick-hair'd;\nSome said he looked grim, and woulde fight:\nHe had a sparth of twenty pound of weight.\nThus was the halle full of divining\nLong after that the sunne gan up spring.\nThe great Theseus that of his sleep is waked\nWith minstrelsy, and noise that was maked,\nHeld yet the chamber of his palace rich,\nTill that the Theban knightes both y-lich\nHonoured were, and to the palace fet.\nDuke Theseus is at a window set,\nArray'd right as he were a god in throne:\nThe people presseth thitherward full soon\nHim for to see, and do him reverence,\nAnd eke to hearken his hest and his sentence.\nAn herald on a scaffold made an O,\nTill the noise of the people was y-do:\nAnd when he saw the people of noise all still,\nThus shewed he the mighty Duke's will.\n\"The lord hath of his high discretion\nConsidered that it were destruction\nTo gentle blood, to fighten in the guise\nOf mortal battle now in this emprise:\nWherefore to shape that they shall not die,\nHe will his firste purpose modify.\nNo man therefore, on pain of loss of life,\nNo manner shot, nor poleaxe, nor short knife\nInto the lists shall send, or thither bring.\nNor short sword for to stick with point biting\nNo man shall draw, nor bear it by his side.\nAnd no man shall unto his fellow ride\nBut one course, with a sharp y-grounden spear:\nFoin if him list on foot, himself to wear.\nAnd he that is at mischief shall be take,\nAnd not slain, but be brought unto the stake,\nThat shall be ordained on either side;\nThither he shall by force, and there abide.\nAnd if so fall the chiefetain be take\nOn either side, or elles slay his make,\nNo longer then the tourneying shall last.\nGod speede you; go forth and lay on fast.\nWith long sword and with mace fight your fill.\nGo now your way; this is the lordes will.\nThe voice of the people touched the heaven,\nSo loude cried they with merry steven:\nGod save such a lord that is so good,\nHe willeth no destruction of blood.\n\nUp go the trumpets and the melody,\nAnd to the listes rode the company\nBy ordinance, throughout the city large,\nHanged with cloth of gold, and not with sarge.\nFull like a lord this noble Duke gan ride,\nAnd these two Thebans upon either side:\n\nAnd after rode the queen and Emily,\nAnd after them another company\nOf one and other, after their degree.\nAnd thus they passed thorough that city\nAnd to the listes came they by time:\nIt was not of the day yet fully prime.\nWhen set was Theseus full rich and high,\nHippolyta the queen and Emily,\nAnd other ladies in their degrees about,\nUnto the seates presseth all the rout.\nAnd westward, through the gates under Mart,\nArcite, and eke the hundred of his part,\nWith banner red, is enter'd right anon;\nAnd in the selve moment Palamon\nIs, under Venus, eastward in the place,\nWith banner white, and hardy cheer and face\nIn all the world, to seeken up and down\nSo even without variatioun\nThere were such companies never tway.\nFor there was none so wise that coulde say\nThat any had of other avantage\nOf worthiness, nor of estate, nor age,\nSo even were they chosen for to guess.\nAnd in two ranges faire they them dress.\nWhen that their names read were every one,\nThat in their number guile were there none,\nThen were the gates shut, and cried was loud;\n\"Do now your devoir, younge knights proud\nThe heralds left their pricking up and down\nNow ring the trumpet loud and clarioun.\nThere is no more to say, but east and west\nIn go the speares sadly in the rest;\nIn go the sharpe spurs into the side.\nThere see me who can joust, and who can ride.\nThere shiver shaftes upon shieldes thick;\nHe feeleth through the hearte-spoon the prick.\nUp spring the speares twenty foot on height;\nOut go the swordes as the silver bright.\nThe helmes they to-hewen, and to-shred;\nOut burst the blood, with sterne streames red.\nWith mighty maces the bones they to-brest.\nHe  through the thickest of the throng gan threst.\nThere stumble steedes strong, and down go all.\nHe rolleth under foot as doth a ball.\nHe foineth on his foe with a trunchoun,\nAnd he him hurtleth with his horse adown.\nHe through the body hurt is, and sith take,\nMaugre his head, and brought unto the stake,\nAs forword was, right there he must abide.\nAnother led is on that other side.\nAnd sometime doth them Theseus to rest,\nThem to refresh, and drinken if them lest.\nFull oft a day have thilke Thebans two\nTogether met and wrought each other woe:\nUnhorsed hath each other of them tway\nThere is no tiger in the vale of Galaphay,\nWhen that her whelp is stole, when it is lite\nSo cruel on the hunter, as Arcite\nFor jealous heart upon this Palamon:\nNor in Belmarie  there is no fell lion,\nThat hunted is, or for his hunger wood\nOr for his prey desireth so the blood,\nAs Palamon to slay his foe Arcite.\nThe jealous strokes upon their helmets bite;\nOut runneth blood on both their sides red,\nSometime an end there is of every deed\nFor ere the sun unto the reste went,\nThe stronge king Emetrius gan hent\nThis Palamon, as he fought with Arcite,\nAnd made his sword deep in his flesh to bite,\nAnd by the force of twenty is he take,\nUnyielding, and is drawn unto the stake.\nAnd in the rescue of this Palamon\nThe stronge king Licurgus is borne down:\nAnd king Emetrius, for all his strength\nIs borne out of his saddle a sword's length,\nSo hit him Palamon ere he were take:\nBut all for nought; he was brought to the stake:\nHis hardy hearte might him helpe naught,\nHe must abide when that he was caught,\nBy force, and eke by composition.\nWho sorroweth now but woful Palamon\nThat must no more go again to fight?\nAnd when that Theseus had seen that sight\nUnto the folk that foughte thus each one,\nHe cried, Ho! no more, for it is done!\nI will be true judge, and not party.\nArcite of Thebes shall have Emily,\nThat by his fortune hath her fairly won.\"\nAnon there is a noise of people gone,\nFor joy of this, so loud and high withal,\nIt seemed that the listes shoulde fall.\n\nWhat can now faire Venus do above?\nWhat saith she now? what doth this queen of love?\nBut weepeth so, for wanting of her will,\nTill that her teares in the listes fill\nShe said: \"I am ashamed doubteless.\"\nSaturnus saide: \"Daughter, hold thy peace.\nMars hath his will, his knight hath all his boon,\nAnd by mine head thou shalt be eased soon.\"\n The trumpeters with the loud minstrelsy,\nThe heralds, that full loude yell and cry,\nBe in their joy for weal of Dan Arcite.\nBut hearken me, and stinte noise a lite,\nWhat a miracle there befell anon\nThis fierce Arcite hath off his helm y-done,\nAnd on a courser for to shew his face\nHe pricketh endelong the large place,\nLooking upward upon this Emily;\nAnd she again him cast a friendly eye\n(For women, as to speaken in commune,\nThey follow all the favour of fortune),\nAnd was all his in cheer, as his in heart.\nOut of the ground a fire infernal start,\nFrom Pluto sent, at request of Saturn\nFor which his horse for fear began to turn,\nAnd leap aside, and founder as he leap\nAnd ere that Arcite may take any keep,\nHe pight him on the pummel of his head.\nThat in the place he lay as he were dead.\nHis breast to-bursten with his saddle-bow.\nAs black he lay as any coal or crow,\nSo was the blood y-run into his face.\nAnon he was y-borne out of the place\nWith hearte sore, to Theseus' palace.\nThen was he carven out of his harness.\nAnd in a bed y-brought full fair and blive\nFor he was yet in mem'ry and alive,\nAnd always crying after Emily.\n\nDuke Theseus, with all his company,\nIs come home to Athens his city,\nWith alle bliss and great solemnity.\nAlbeit that this aventure was fall,\nHe woulde not discomforte them all\nThen said eke, that Arcite should not die,\nHe should be healed of his malady.\nAnd of another thing they were as fain.\nThat of them alle was there no one slain,\nAll were they sorely hurt, and namely one,\nThat with a spear was thirled his breast-bone.\nTo other woundes, and to broken arms,\nSome hadden salves, and some hadden charms:\nAnd pharmacies of herbs, and eke save\nThey dranken, for they would their lives have.\nFor which this noble Duke, as he well can,\nComforteth and honoureth every man,\nAnd made revel all the longe night,\nUnto the strange lordes, as was right.\nNor there was holden no discomforting,\nBut as at jousts or at a tourneying;\nFor soothly there was no discomfiture,\nFor falling is not but an aventure.\nNor to be led by force unto a stake\nUnyielding, and with twenty knights y-take\nOne person all alone, withouten mo',\nAnd harried forth by armes, foot, and toe,\nAnd eke his steede driven forth with staves,\nWith footmen, bothe yeomen and eke knaves,\nIt was aretted him no villainy:\nThere may no man clepen it cowardy.\nFor which anon Duke Theseus let cry, --\nTo stenten alle rancour and envy, --\nThe gree as well on one side as the other,\nAnd either side alike as other's brother:\nAnd gave them giftes after their degree,\nAnd held a feaste fully dayes three:\nAnd conveyed the kinges worthily\nOut of his town a journee largely\nAnd home went every man the righte way,\nThere was no more but \"Farewell, Have good day.\"\nOf this bataille I will no more indite\nBut speak of Palamon and of Arcite.\n\nSwelleth the breast of Arcite and the sore\nIncreaseth at his hearte more and more.\nThe clotted blood, for any leache-craft\nCorrupteth and is in his bouk y-laft\nThat neither veine blood nor ventousing,\nNor drink of herbes may be his helping.\nThe virtue expulsive or animal,\nFrom thilke virtue called natural,\nNor may the venom voide, nor expel\nThe pipes of his lungs began to swell\nAnd every lacert in his breast adown\nIs shent with venom and corruption.\nHim gaineth neither, for to get his life,\nVomit upward, nor downward laxative;\nAll is to-bursten thilke region;\nNature hath now no domination.\nAnd certainly where nature will not wirch,\nFarewell physic: go bear the man to chirch.\nThis all and some is, Arcite must die.\nFor which he sendeth after Emily,\nAnd Palamon, that was his cousin dear,\nThen said he thus, as ye shall after hear.\n\n\"Nought may the woful spirit in mine heart\nDeclare one point of all my sorrows' smart\nTo you, my lady, that I love the most:\nBut I bequeath  the service of my ghost\nTo you aboven every creature,\nSince that my life ne may no longer dure.\nAlas the woe! alas, the paines strong\nThat I for you have suffered and so long!\nAlas the death,  alas, mine Emily!\nAlas departing of our company!\nAlas, mine hearte's queen! alas, my wife!\nMine hearte's lady, ender of my life!\nWhat is this world? what aske men to have?\nNow with his love, now in his colde grave\nAl one, withouten any company.\nFarewell, my sweet, farewell, mine Emily,\nAnd softly take me in your armes tway,\nFor love of God, and hearken what I say.\nI have here with my cousin Palamon\nHad strife and rancour many a day agone,\nFor love of you, and for my jealousy.\nAnd Jupiter so wis my soule gie,\nTo speaken of a servant properly,\nWith alle circumstances truely,\nThat is to say, truth, honour, and knighthead,\nWisdom, humbless, estate, and high kindred,\nFreedom, and all that longeth to that art,\nSo Jupiter have of my soul part,\nAs in this world right now I know not one,\nSo worthy to be lov'd as Palamon,\nThat serveth you, and will do all his life.\nAnd if that you shall ever be a wife,\nForget not Palamon, the gentle man.\"\n\nAnd with that word his speech to fail began.\nFor from his feet up to his breast was come\nThe cold of death, that had him overnome.\nAnd yet moreover in his armes two\nThe vital strength is lost, and all ago.\nOnly the intellect, withoute more,\nThat dwelled in his hearte sick and sore,\nGan faile, when the hearte felte death;\nDusked his eyen two, and fail'd his breath.\nBut on his lady yet he cast his eye;\nHis laste word was; \"Mercy, Emily!\"\nHis spirit changed house, and wente there,\nAs I came never I cannot telle where.\nTherefore I stent, I am no divinister;\nOf soules find I nought in this register.\nNe me list not th' opinions to tell\nOf them, though that they writen where they dwell;\nArcite is cold, there Mars his soule gie.\nNow will I speake forth of Emily.\n\nShriek'd Emily, and howled Palamon,\nAnd Theseus his sister took anon\nSwooning, and bare her from the corpse away.\nWhat helpeth it to tarry forth the day,\nTo telle how she wept both eve and morrow?\nFor in such cases women have such sorrow,\nWhen that their husbands be from them y-go,\nThat for the more part they sorrow so,\nOr elles fall into such malady,\nThat at the laste certainly they die.\nInfinite be the sorrows and the tears\nOf olde folk, and folk of tender years,\nIn all the town, for death of this Theban:\nFor him there weepeth bothe child and man.\nSo great a weeping was there none certain,\nWhen Hector was y-brought, all fresh y-slain,\nTo Troy: alas! the pity that was there,\nScratching of cheeks, and rending eke of hair.\n\"Why wouldest thou be dead?\" these women cry,\n\"And haddest gold enough, and Emily.\"\nNo manner man might gladden Theseus,\nSaving his olde father Egeus,\nThat knew this worlde's transmutatioun,\nAs he had seen it changen up and down,\nJoy after woe, and woe after gladness;\nAnd shewed him example and likeness.\n\"Right as there died never man,\" quoth he,\n\"That he ne liv'd in earth in some degree,\nRight so there lived never man,\" he said,\n\"In all this world, that sometime be not died.\nThis world is but a throughfare full of woe,\nAnd we be pilgrims, passing to and fro:\nDeath is an end of every worldly sore.\"\nAnd over all this said he yet much more\nTo this effect, full wisely to exhort\nThe people, that they should them recomfort.\nDuke Theseus, with all his busy cure,\nCasteth about, where that the sepulture\nOf good Arcite may best y-maked be,\nAnd eke most honourable in his degree.\nAnd at the last he took conclusion,\nThat there as first Arcite and Palamon\nHadde for love the battle them between,\nThat in that selve grove, sweet and green,\nThere as he had his amorous desires,\nHis complaint, and for love his hote fires,\nHe woulde make a fire, in which th' office\nOf funeral he might all accomplice;\nAnd let anon command to hack and hew\nThe oakes old, and lay them on a rew\nIn culpons, well arrayed for to brenne.\nHis officers with swifte feet they renne\nAnd ride anon at his commandement.\nAnd after this, Duke Theseus hath sent\nAfter a bier, and it all oversprad\nWith cloth of gold, the richest that he had;\nAnd of the same suit he clad Arcite.\nUpon his handes were his gloves white,\nEke on his head a crown of laurel green,\nAnd in his hand a sword full bright and keen.\nHe laid him bare the visage on the bier,\nTherewith he wept, that pity was to hear.\nAnd, for the people shoulde see him all,\nWhen it was day he brought them to the hall,\nThat roareth of the crying and the soun'.\nThen came this woful Theban, Palamon,\nWith sluttery beard, and ruggy ashy hairs,\nIn clothes black, y-dropped all with tears,\nAnd (passing over weeping Emily)\nThe ruefullest of all the company.\nAnd inasmuch as the service should be\nThe more noble and rich in its degree,\nDuke Theseus let forth three steedes bring,\nThat trapped were in steel all glittering.\nAnd covered with the arms of Dan Arcite.\nUpon these steedes, that were great and white,\nThere satte folk, of whom one bare his shield,\nAnother his spear in his handes held;\nThe thirde bare with him his bow Turkeis,\nOf brent gold was the case and the harness:\nAnd ride forth a pace with sorrowful cheer\nToward the grove, as ye shall after hear.\n\nThe noblest of the Greekes that there were\nUpon their shoulders carried the bier,\nWith slacke pace, and eyen red and wet,\nThroughout the city, by the master street,\nThat spread was all with black, and wondrous high\nRight of the same is all the street y-wrie.\nUpon the right hand went old Egeus,\nAnd on the other side Duke Theseus,\nWith vessels in their hand of gold full fine,\nAll full of honey, milk, and blood, and wine;\nEke Palamon, with a great company;\nAnd after that came woful Emily,\nWith fire in hand, as was that time the guise,\nTo do th' office of funeral service.\n\nHigh labour, and full great appareling\nWas at the service, and the pyre-making,\nThat with its greene top the heaven raught,\nAnd twenty fathom broad its armes straught:\nThis is to say, the boughes were so broad.\nOf straw first there was laid many a load.\nBut how the pyre was maked up on height,\nAnd eke the names how the trees hight,\nAs oak, fir, birch, asp, alder, holm,

scholer,\nHad learned art, but all his fantasy\nWas turned for to learn astrology.\nHe coude a certain of conclusions\nTo deeme by interrogations,\nIf that men asked him in certain hours,\nWhen that men should have drought or elles show'rs:\nOr if men asked him what shoulde fall\nOf everything, I may not reckon all.\n\nThis clerk was called Hendy Nicholas;\nOf derne love he knew and of solace;\nAnd therewith he was sly and full privy,\nAnd like a maiden meek for to see.\nA chamber had he in that hostelry\nAlone, withouten any company,\nFull fetisly y-dight with herbes swoot,\nAnd he himself was sweet as is the root\nOf liquorice, or any setewall.\nHis Almagest, and bookes great and small,\nHis astrolabe,  belonging to his art,\nHis augrim stones, layed fair apart\nOn shelves couched at his bedde's head,\nHis press y-cover'd with a falding red.\nAnd all above there lay a gay psalt'ry\nOn which he made at nightes melody,\nSo sweetely, that all the chamber rang:\nAnd Angelus ad virginem he sang.\nAnd after that he sung the kinge's note;\nFull often blessed was his merry throat.\nAnd thus this sweete clerk his time spent\nAfter his friendes finding and his rent.\n\nThis carpenter had wedded new a wife,\nWhich that he loved more than his life:\nOf eighteen year, I guess, she was of age.\nJealous he was, and held her narr'w in cage,\nFor she was wild and young, and he was old,\nAnd deemed himself belike a cuckold.\nHe knew not Cato, for his wit was rude,\nThat bade a man wed his similitude.\nMen shoulde wedden after their estate,\nFor youth and eld are often at debate.\nBut since that he was fallen in the snare,\nHe must endure (as other folk) his care.\nFair was this younge wife, and therewithal\nAs any weasel her body gent and small.\nA seint she weared, barred all of silk,\nA barm-cloth eke as white as morning milk\nUpon her lendes, full of many a gore.\nWhite was her smock, and broider'd all before,\nAnd eke behind, on her collar about\nOf coal-black silk, within and eke without.\nThe tapes of her white volupere\nWere of the same suit of her collere;\nHer fillet broad of silk, and set full high:\nAnd sickerly she had a likerous eye.\nFull small y-pulled were her browes two,\nAnd they were bent, and black as any sloe.\nShe was well more blissful on to see\nThan is the newe perjenete tree;\nAnd softer than the wool is of a wether.\nAnd by her girdle hung a purse of leather,\nTassel'd with silk, and pearled with latoun.\nIn all this world to seeken up and down\nThere is no man so wise, that coude thenche\nSo gay a popelot, or such a wench.\nFull brighter was the shining of her hue,\nThan in the Tower the noble forged new.\nBut of her song, it was as loud and yern,\nAs any swallow chittering on a bern.\nThereto she coulde skip, and make a game\nAs any kid or calf following his dame.\nHer mouth was sweet as braket, or as methe\nOr hoard of apples, laid in hay or heath.\nWincing she was as is a jolly colt,\nLong as a mast, and upright as a bolt.\nA brooch she bare upon her low collere,\nAs broad as is the boss of a bucklere.\nHer shoon were laced on her legges high;\nShe was a primerole, a piggesnie ,\nFor any lord t' have ligging in his bed,\nOr yet for any good yeoman to wed.\n\nNow, sir, and eft sir, so befell the case,\nThat on a day this Hendy Nicholas\nFell with this younge wife to rage and play,\nWhile that her husband was at Oseney,\nAs clerkes be full subtle and full quaint.\nAnd privily he caught her by the queint,\nAnd said; \"Y-wis, but if I have my will,\nFor derne love of thee, leman, I spill.\"\nAnd helde her fast by the haunche bones,\nAnd saide \"Leman, love me well at once,\nOr I will dien, all so God me save.\"\nAnd she sprang as a colt doth in the trave:\nAnd with her head she writhed fast away,\nAnd said; \"I will not kiss thee, by my fay.\nWhy let be,\" quoth she, \"let be, Nicholas,\nOr I will cry out harow and alas!\nDo away your handes, for your courtesy.\"\nThis Nicholas gan mercy for to cry,\nAnd spake so fair, and proffer'd him so fast,\nThat she her love him granted at the last,\nAnd swore her oath by Saint Thomas of Kent,\nThat she would be at his commandement,\nWhen that she may her leisure well espy.\n\"My husband is so full of jealousy,\nThat but ye waite well, and be privy,\nI wot right well I am but dead,\" quoth she.\n\"Ye muste be full derne as in this case.\"\n\"Nay, thereof care thee nought,\" quoth Nicholas:\n\"A clerk had litherly beset his while,\nBut if he could a carpenter beguile.\"\nAnd thus they were accorded and y-sworn\nTo wait a time, as I have said beforn.\nWhen Nicholas had done thus every deal,\nAnd thwacked her about the lendes well,\nHe kiss'd her sweet, and taketh his psalt'ry\nAnd playeth fast, and maketh melody.\nThen fell it thus, that to the parish church,\nOf Christe's owen workes for to wirch,\nThis good wife went upon a holy day;\nHer forehead shone as bright as any day,\nSo was it washen, when she left her werk.\n\nNow was there of that church a parish clerk,\nThe which that was y-cleped Absolon.\nCurl'd was his hair, and as the gold it shone,\nAnd strutted as a fanne large and broad;\nFull straight and even lay his jolly shode.\nHis rode was red, his eyen grey as goose,\nWith Paule's windows carven on his shoes\nIn hosen red he went full fetisly.\nY-clad he was full small and properly,\nAll in a kirtle of a light waget;\nFull fair and thicke be the pointes set,\nAnd thereupon he had a gay surplice,\nAs white as is the blossom on the rise.\nA merry child he was, so God me save;\nWell could he letten blood, and clip, and shave,\nAnd make a charter of land, and a quittance.\nIn twenty manners could he trip and dance,\nAfter the school of Oxenforde tho,\nAnd with his legges caste to and fro;\nAnd playen songes on a small ribible;\nThereto he sung sometimes a loud quinible\nAnd as well could he play on a gitern.\nIn all the town was brewhouse nor tavern,\nThat he not visited with his solas,\nThere as that any garnard tapstere was.\nBut sooth to say he was somedeal squaimous\nOf farting, and of speeche dangerous.\nThis Absolon, that jolly was and gay,\nWent with a censer on the holy day,\nCensing the wives of the parish fast;\nAnd many a lovely look he on them cast,\nAnd namely on this carpenter's wife:\nTo look on her him thought a merry life.\nShe was so proper, and sweet, and likerous.\nI dare well say, if she had been a mouse,\nAnd he a cat, he would her hent anon.\nThis parish clerk, this jolly Absolon,\nHath in his hearte such a love-longing!\nThat of no wife took he none offering;\nFor courtesy he said he woulde none.\nThe moon at night full clear and brighte shone,\nAnd Absolon his gitern hath y-taken,\nFor paramours he thoughte for to waken,\nAnd forth he went, jolif and amorous,\nTill he came to the carpentere's house,\nA little after the cock had y-crow,\nAnd dressed him under a shot window ,\nThat was upon the carpentere's wall.\nHe singeth in his voice gentle and small;\n\"Now, dear lady, if thy will be,\nI pray that ye will rue on me;\"\nFull well accordant to his giterning.\nThis carpenter awoke, and heard him sing,\nAnd spake unto his wife, and said anon,\nWhat Alison, hear'st thou not Absolon,\nThat chanteth thus under our bower wall?\"\nAnd she answer'd her husband therewithal;\n\"Yes, God wot, John, I hear him every deal.\"\nThis passeth forth; what will ye bet than well?\n\nFrom day to day this jolly Absolon\nSo wooeth her, that him is woebegone.\nHe waketh all the night, and all the day,\nTo comb his lockes broad, and make him gay.\nHe wooeth her by means and by brocage,\nAnd swore he woulde be her owen page.\nHe singeth brokking as a nightingale.\nHe sent her piment , mead, and spiced ale,\nAnd wafers piping hot out of the glede:\nAnd, for she was of town, he proffer'd meed.\nFor some folk will be wonnen for richess,\nAnd some for strokes, and some with gentiless.\nSometimes, to show his lightness and mast'ry,\nHe playeth Herod  on a scaffold high.\nBut what availeth him as in this case?\nSo loveth she the Hendy Nicholas,\nThat Absolon may blow the bucke's horn:\nHe had for all his labour but a scorn.\nAnd thus she maketh Absolon her ape,\nAnd all his earnest turneth to a jape.\nFull sooth is this proverb, it is no lie;\nMen say right thus alway; the nighe sly\nMaketh oft time the far lief to be loth.\nFor though that Absolon be wood or wroth\nBecause that he far was from her sight,\nThis nigh Nicholas stood still in his light.\nNow bear thee well, thou Hendy Nicholas,\nFor Absolon may wail and sing \"Alas!\"\n\nAnd so befell, that on a Saturday\nThis carpenter was gone to Oseney,\nAnd Hendy Nicholas and Alison\nAccorded were to this conclusion,\nThat Nicholas shall shape him a wile\nThe silly jealous husband to beguile;\nAnd if so were the game went aright,\nShe shoulde sleepen in his arms all night;\nFor this was her desire and his also.\nAnd right anon, withoute wordes mo',\nThis Nicholas no longer would he tarry,\nBut doth full soft unto his chamber carry\nBoth meat and drinke for a day or tway.\nAnd to her husband bade her for to say,\nIf that he asked after Nicholas,\nShe shoulde say, \"She wist not where he was;\nOf all the day she saw him not with eye;\nShe trowed he was in some malady,\nFor no cry that her maiden could him call\nHe would answer, for nought that might befall.\"\nThus passed forth all thilke Saturday,\nThat Nicholas still in his chamber lay,\nAnd ate, and slept, and didde what him list\nTill Sunday, that the sunne went to rest.\nThis silly carpenter had great marvaill\nOf Nicholas, or what thing might him ail,\nAnd said; \"I am adrad, by Saint Thomas!\nIt standeth not aright with Nicholas:\nGod shielde that he died suddenly.\nThis world is now full fickle sickerly.\nI saw to-day a corpse y-borne to chirch,\nThat now on Monday last I saw him wirch.\n\"Go up,\" quod he unto his knave, \"anon;\nClepe at his door, or knocke with a stone:\nLook how it is, and tell me boldely.\"\nThis knave went him up full sturdily,\nAnd, at the chamber door while that he stood,\nHe cried and knocked as that he were wood:\n\"What how? what do ye, Master Nicholay?\nHow may ye sleepen all the longe day?\"\nBut all for nought, he hearde not a word.\nAn hole he found full low upon the board,\nWhere as the cat was wont in for to creep,\nAnd at that hole he looked in full deep,\nAnd at the last he had of him a sight.\nThis Nicholas sat ever gaping upright,\nAs he had kyked on the newe moon.\nAdown he went, and told his master soon,\nIn what array he saw this ilke man.\n\nThis carpenter to blissen him began,\nAnd said: \"Now help us, Sainte Frideswide.\nA man wot little what shall him betide.\nThis man is fall'n with his astronomy\nInto some woodness or some agony.\nI thought aye well how that it shoulde be.\nMen should know nought of Godde's privity.\nYea, blessed be alway a lewed man,\nThat nought but only his believe can.\nSo far'd another clerk with astronomy:\nHe walked in the fieldes for to pry\nUpon the starres, what there should befall,\nTill he was in a marle pit y-fall.\nHe saw not that. But yet, by Saint Thomas!\nMe rueth sore of Hendy Nicholas:\nHe shall be rated of his studying,\nIf that I may, by Jesus, heaven's king!\nGet me a staff, that I may underspore\nWhile that thou, Robin, heavest off the door:\nHe shall out of his studying, as I guess.\"\nAnd to the chamber door he gan him dress\nHis knave was a strong carl for the nonce,\nAnd by the hasp he heav'd it off at once;\nInto the floor the door fell down anon.\nThis Nicholas sat aye as still as stone,\nAnd ever he gap'd upward into the air.\nThe carpenter ween'd he were in despair,\nAnd hent him by the shoulders mightily,\nAnd shook him hard, and cried spitously;\n\"What, Nicholas? what how, man? look adown:\nAwake, and think on Christe's passioun.\nI crouche thee from elves, and from wights.\nTherewith the night-spell said he anon rights,\nOn the four halves of the house about,\nAnd on the threshold of the door without.\n\"Lord Jesus Christ, and Sainte Benedight,\nBlesse this house from every wicked wight,\nFrom the night mare, the white Pater-noster;\nWhere wonnest thou now, Sainte Peter's sister?\"\nAnd at the last this Hendy Nicholas\nGan for to sigh full sore, and said; \"Alas!\nShall all time world be lost eftsoones now?\"\nThis carpenter answer'd; \"What sayest thou?\nWhat?

tell.\nA miller was there dwelling many a day,\nAs any peacock he was proud and gay:\nPipen he could, and fish, and nettes bete,\nAnd turne cups, and wrestle well, and shete.\nAye by his belt he bare a long pavade,\nAnd of his sword full trenchant was the blade.\nA jolly popper bare he in his pouch;\nThere was no man for peril durst him touch.\nA Sheffield whittle bare he in his hose.\nRound was his face, and camuse was his nose.\nAs pilled as an ape's was his skull.\nHe was a market-beter at the full.\nThere durste no wight hand upon him legge,\nThat he ne swore anon he should abegge.\n\nA thief he was, for sooth, of corn and meal,\nAnd that a sly, and used well to steal.\nHis name was hoten deinous Simekin\nA wife he hadde, come of noble kin:\nThe parson of the town her father was.\nWith her he gave full many a pan of brass,\nFor that Simkin should in his blood ally.\nShe was y-foster'd in a nunnery:\nFor Simkin woulde no wife, as he said,\nBut she were well y-nourish'd, and a maid,\nTo saven his estate and yeomanry:\nAnd she was proud, and pert as is a pie.\nA full fair sight it was to see them two;\nOn holy days before her would he go\nWith his tippet y-bound about his head;\nAnd she came after in a gite of red,\nAnd Simkin hadde hosen of the same.\nThere durste no wight call her aught but Dame:\nNone was so hardy, walking by that way,\nThat with her either durste rage or play,\nBut if he would be slain by Simekin\nWith pavade, or with knife, or bodekin.\nFor jealous folk be per'lous evermo':\nAlgate they would their wives wende so.\nAnd eke for she was somewhat smutterlich,\nShe was as dign as water in a ditch,\nAnd all so full of hoker, and bismare.\nHer thoughte that a lady should her spare,\nWhat for her kindred, and her nortelrie\nThat she had learned in the nunnery.\n\nOne daughter hadde they betwixt them two\nOf twenty year, withouten any mo,\nSaving a child that was of half year age,\nIn cradle it lay, and was a proper page.\nThis wenche thick and well y-growen was,\nWith camuse nose, and eyen gray as glass;\nWith buttocks broad, and breastes round and high;\nBut right fair was her hair, I will not lie.\nThe parson of the town, for she was fair,\nIn purpose was to make of her his heir\nBoth of his chattels and his messuage,\nAnd strange he made it of her marriage.\nHis purpose was for to bestow her high\nInto some worthy blood of ancestry.\nFor holy Church's good may be dispended\nOn holy Church's blood that is descended.\nTherefore he would his holy blood honour\nThough that he holy Churche should devour.\n\nGreat soken hath this miller, out of doubt,\nWith wheat and malt, of all the land about;\nAnd namely there was a great college\nMen call the Soler Hall at Cantebrege,\nThere was their wheat and eke their malt y-ground.\nAnd on a day it happed in a stound,\nSick lay the manciple of a malady,\nMen weened wisly that he shoulde die.\nFor which this miller stole both meal and corn\nAn hundred times more than beforn.\nFor theretofore he stole but courteously,\nBut now he was a thief outrageously.\nFor which the warden chid and made fare,\nBut thereof set the miller not a tare;\nHe crack'd his boast, and swore it was not so.\n\nThen were there younge poore scholars two,\nThat dwelled in the hall of which I say;\nTestif they were, and lusty for to play;\nAnd only for their mirth and revelry\nUpon the warden busily they cry,\nTo give them leave for but a little stound,\nTo go to mill, and see their corn y-ground:\nAnd hardily they durste lay their neck,\nThe miller should not steal them half a peck\nOf corn by sleight, nor them by force bereave\nAnd at the last the warden give them leave:\nJohn hight the one, and Alein hight the other,\nOf one town were they born, that highte Strother,\nFar in the North, I cannot tell you where.\nThis Alein he made ready all his gear,\nAnd on a horse the sack he cast anon:\nForth went Alein the clerk, and also John,\nWith good sword and with buckler by their side.\nJohn knew the way, him needed not no guide,\nAnd at the mill the sack adown he lay'th.\n\nAlein spake first; \"All hail, Simon, in faith,\nHow fares thy faire daughter, and thy wife.\"\n\"Alein, welcome,\" quoth Simkin, \"by my life,\nAnd John also: how now, what do ye here?\"\n\"By God, Simon,\" quoth John, \"need has no peer.\nHim serve himself behoves that has no swain,\nOr else he is a fool, as clerkes sayn.\nOur manciple I hope he will be dead,\nSo workes aye the wanges in his head:\nAnd therefore is I come, and eke Alein,\nTo grind our corn and carry it home again:\nI pray you speed us hence as well ye may.\"\n\"It shall be done,\" quoth Simkin, \"by my fay.\nWhat will ye do while that it is in hand?\"\n\"By God, right by the hopper will I stand,\"\nQuoth John, \"and see how that the corn goes in.\nYet saw I never, by my father's kin,\nHow that the hopper wagges to and fro.\"\nAlein answered, \"John, and wilt thou so?\nThen will I be beneathe, by my crown,\nAnd see how that the meale falls adown\nInto the trough, that shall be my disport:\nFor, John, in faith I may be of your sort;\nI is as ill a miller as is ye.\"\n\nThis miller smiled at their nicety,\nAnd thought, \"All this is done but for a wile.\nThey weenen that no man may them beguile,\nBut by my thrift yet shall I blear their eye,\nFor all the sleight in their philosophy.\nThe more quainte knackes that they make,\nThe more will I steal when that I take.\nInstead of flour yet will I give them bren.\nThe greatest clerks are not the wisest men,\nAs whilom to the wolf thus spake the mare:\nOf all their art ne count I not a tare.\"\nOut at the door he went full privily,\nWhen that he saw his time, softely.\nHe looked up and down, until he found\nThe clerkes' horse, there as he stood y-bound\nBehind the mill, under a levesell:\nAnd to the horse he went him fair and well,\nAnd stripped off the bridle right anon.\nAnd when the horse was loose, he gan to gon\nToward the fen, where wilde mares run,\nForth, with \"Wehee!\" through thick and eke through thin.\nThis miller went again, no word he said,\nBut did his note, and with these clerkes play'd,\nTill that their corn was fair and well y-ground.\nAnd when the meal was sacked and y-bound,\nThen John went out, and found his horse away,\nAnd gan to cry, \"Harow, and well-away!\nOur horse is lost: Alein, for Godde's bones,\nStep on thy feet; come off, man, all at once:\nAlas! our warden has his palfrey lorn.\"\nThis Alein all forgot, both meal and corn;\nAll was out of his mind his husbandry.\n\"What, which way is he gone?\" he gan to cry.\nThe wife came leaping inward at a renne,\nShe said; \"Alas! your horse went to the fen\nWith wilde mares, as fast as he could go.\nUnthank come on his hand that bound him so\nAnd his that better should have knit the rein.\"\n\"Alas!\" quoth John, \"Alein, for Christes pain\nLay down thy sword, and I shall mine also.\nI is full wight, God wate, as is a roe.\nBy Godde's soul he shall not scape us bathe.\nWhy n' had thou put the capel in the lathe?\nIll hail, Alein, by God thou is a fonne.\"\nThese silly clerkes have full fast y-run\nToward the fen, both Alein and eke John;\nAnd when the miller saw that they were gone,\nHe half a bushel of their flour did take,\nAnd bade his wife go knead it in a cake.\nHe said; I trow, the clerkes were afeard,\nYet can a miller make a clerkes beard,\nFor all his art: yea, let them go their way!\nLo where they go! yea, let the children play:\nThey get him not so lightly, by my crown.\"\nThese silly clerkes runnen up and down\nWith \"Keep, keep; stand, stand; jossa, warderere.\nGo whistle thou, and I shall keep him here.\"\nBut shortly, till that it was very night\nThey coulde not, though they did all their might,\nTheir capel catch, he ran alway so fast:\nTill in a ditch they caught him at the last.\n\nWeary and wet, as beastes in the rain,\nComes silly John, and with him comes Alein.\n\"Alas,\" quoth John, \"the day that I was born!\nNow are we driv'n till hething and till scorn.\nOur corn is stol'n, men will us fonnes call,\nBoth the warden, and eke our fellows all,\nAnd namely the miller, well-away!\"\nThus plained John, as he went by the way\nToward the mill, and Bayard in his hand.\nThe miller sitting by the fire he fand.\nFor it was night, and forther might they not,\nBut for the love of God they him besought\nOf herberow and ease, for their penny.\nThe miller said again,\" If there be any,\nSuch as it is, yet shall ye have your part.\nMine house is strait, but ye have learned art;\nYe can by arguments maken a place\nA mile broad, of twenty foot of space.\nLet see now if this place may suffice,\nOr make it room with speech, as is your guise.\"\n\"Now, Simon,\" said this John, \"by Saint Cuthberd\nAye is thou merry, and that is fair answer'd.\nI have heard say, man shall take of two things,\nSuch as he findes, or such as he brings.\nBut specially I pray thee, hoste dear,\nGar  us have meat and drink, and make us cheer,\nAnd we shall pay thee truly at the full:\nWith empty hand men may not hawkes tull.\nLo here our silver

bed.\nWith sheetes and with chalons fair y-spread,\nNot from his owen bed ten foot or twelve:\nHis daughter had a bed all by herselve,\nRight in the same chamber by and by:\nIt might no better be, and cause why,\nThere was no roomer herberow in the place.\nThey suppen, and they speaken of solace,\nAnd drinken ever strong ale at the best.\nAboute midnight went they all to rest.\nWell had this miller varnished his head;\nFull pale he was, fordrunken, and nought red.\nHe yoxed, and he spake thorough the nose,\nAs he were in the quakke, or in the pose.\nTo bed he went, and with him went his wife,\nAs any jay she light was and jolife,\nSo was her jolly whistle well y-wet.\nThe cradle at her beddes feet was set,\nTo rock, and eke to give the child to suck.\nAnd when that drunken was all in the crock\nTo bedde went the daughter right anon,\nTo bedde went Alein, and also John.\nThere was no more; needed them no dwale.\nThis miller had, so wisly bibbed ale,\nThat as a horse he snorted in

heard this melody,\nHe poked John, and saide: \"Sleepest thou?\nHeardest thou ever such a song ere now?\nLo what a compline is y-mell them all.\nA wilde fire upon their bodies fall,\nWho hearken'd ever such a ferly thing?\nYea, they shall have the flow'r of ill ending!\nThis longe night there tides me no rest.\nBut yet no force, all shall be for the best.\nFor, John,\" said he, \"as ever may I thrive,\nIf that I may, yon wenche will I swive.\nSome easement has law y-shapen us\nFor, John, there is a law that sayeth thus,\nThat if a man in one point be aggriev'd,\nThat in another he shall be relievd.\nOur corn is stol'n, soothly it is no nay,\nAnd we have had an evil fit to-day.\nAnd since I shall have none amendement\nAgainst my loss, I will have easement:\nBy Godde's soul, it shall none, other be.\"\nThis John answer'd; Alein, avise thee:\nThe miller is a perilous man,\" he said,\n\"And if that he out of his sleep abraid,\nHe mighte do us both a villainy.\"\nAlein answer'd; \"I count him not a fly.\nAnd up he rose, and by the wench he crept.\nThis wenche lay upright, and fast she slept,\nTill he so nigh was, ere she might espy,\nThat it had been too late for to cry:\nAnd, shortly for to say, they were at one.\nNow play, Alein, for I will speak of John.\n\nThis John lay still a furlong way  or two,\nAnd to himself he made ruth and woe.\n\"Alas!\" quoth he, \"this is a wicked jape;\nNow may I say, that I is but an ape.\nYet has my fellow somewhat for his harm;\nHe has the miller's daughter in his arm:\nHe auntred him, and hath his needes sped,\nAnd I lie as a draff-sack in my bed;\nAnd when this jape is told another day,\nI shall be held a daffe or a cockenay\nI will arise, and auntre it, by my fay:\nUnhardy is unsely,  as men say.\"\nAnd up he rose, and softely he went\nUnto the cradle, and in his hand it hent,\nAnd bare it soft unto his beddes feet.\nSoon after this the wife her routing lete,\nAnd gan awake, and went her out to piss\nAnd came again and gan the cradle miss\nAnd groped here and there, but she found none.\n\"Alas!\" quoth she, \"I had almost misgone\nI had almost gone to the clerkes' bed.\nEy! Benedicite, then had I foul y-sped.\"\nAnd forth she went, till she the cradle fand.\nShe groped alway farther with her hand\nAnd found the bed, and thoughte not but good\nBecause that the cradle by it stood,\nAnd wist not where she was, for it was derk;\nBut fair and well she crept in by the clerk,\nAnd lay full still, and would have caught a sleep.\nWithin a while this John the Clerk up leap\nAnd on this goode wife laid on full sore;\nSo merry a fit had she not had full yore.\nHe pricked hard and deep, as he were mad.\n\nThis jolly life have these two clerkes had,\nTill that the thirde cock began to sing.\nAlein wax'd weary in the morrowing,\nFor he had swonken all the longe night,\nAnd saide; \"Farewell, Malkin, my sweet wight.\nThe day is come, I may no longer bide,\nBut evermore, where so I go or ride,\nI is thine owen clerk, so have I hele.\"\n\"Now, deare leman,\" quoth she, \"go, fare wele:\nBut ere thou go, one thing I will thee tell.\nWhen that thou wendest homeward by the mill,\nRight at the entry of the door behind\nThou shalt a cake of half a bushel find,\nThat was y-maked of thine owen meal,\nWhich that I help'd my father for to steal.\nAnd goode leman, God thee save and keep.\"\nAnd with that word she gan almost to weep.\nAlein uprose and thought, \"Ere the day daw\nI will go creepen in by my fellaw:\"\nAnd found the cradle with his hand anon.\n\"By God!\" thought he, \"all wrong I have misgone:\nMy head is totty of my swink to-night,\nThat maketh me that I go not aright.\nI wot well by the cradle I have misgo';\nHere lie the miller and his wife also.\"\nAnd forth he went a twenty devil way\nUnto the bed, there as the miller lay.\nHe ween'd t' have creeped by his fellow John,\nAnd by the miller in he crept anon,\nAnd caught him by the neck, and gan him shake,\nAnd said; \"Thou John, thou swines-head, awake\nFor Christes soul, and hear a noble game!\nFor by that lord that called is Saint Jame,\nAs I have thries in this shorte night\nSwived the miller's daughter bolt-upright,\nWhile thou hast as a coward lain aghast.\"\n\"Thou false harlot,\" quoth the miller, \"hast?\nAh, false traitor, false clerk,\" quoth he,\n\"Thou shalt be dead, by Godde's dignity,\nWho durste be so bold to disparage\nMy daughter, that is come of such lineage?\"\nAnd by the throate-ball he caught Alein,\nAnd he him hent dispiteously again,\nAnd on the nose he smote him with his fist;\nDown ran the bloody stream upon his breast:\nAnd in the floor with nose and mouth all broke\nThey wallow, as do two pigs in a poke.\nAnd up they go, and down again anon,\nTill that the miller spurned on a stone,\nAnd down he backward fell upon his wife,\nThat wiste nothing of this nice strife:\nFor she was fall'n asleep a little wight\nWith John the clerk, that waked had all night:\nAnd with the fall out of her sleep she braid.\n\"Help, holy cross of Bromeholm,\"  she said;\n\"In manus tuas!

their spicery,\nTheir chaffare was so thriftly and so new,\nThat every wight had dainty to chaffare\nWith them, and eke to selle them their ware.\n\nNow fell it, that the masters of that sort\nHave shapen them to Rome for to wend,\nWere it for chapmanhood or for disport,\nNone other message would they thither send,\nBut come themselves to Rome, this is the end:\nAnd in such place as thought them a vantage\nFor their intent, they took their herbergage.\n\nSojourned have these merchants in that town\nA certain time as fell to their pleasance:\nAnd so befell, that th' excellent renown\nOf th' emperore's daughter, Dame Constance,\nReported was, with every circumstance,\nUnto these Syrian merchants in such wise,\nFrom day to day, as I shall you devise\n\nThis was the common voice of every man\n\"Our emperor of Rome, God him see,\nA daughter hath, that since the the world began,\nTo reckon as well her goodness and beauty,\nWas never such another as is she:\nI pray to God in honour her sustene,\nAnd would she were of all Europe the queen.\n\n\"In her is highe beauty without pride,\nAnd youth withoute greenhood or folly:\nTo all her workes virtue is her guide;\nHumbless hath slain in her all tyranny:\nShe is the mirror of all courtesy,\nHer heart a very chamber of holiness,\nHer hand minister of freedom for almess.\"\n\nAnd all this voice was sooth, as God is true;\nBut now to purpose let us turn again.\nThese merchants have done freight their shippes new,\nAnd when they have this blissful maiden seen,\nHome to Syria then they went full fain,\nAnd did their needes, as they have done yore,\nAnd liv'd in weal; I can you say no more.\n\nNow fell it, that these merchants stood in grace\nOf him that was the Soudan of Syrie:\nFor when they came from any strange place\nHe would of his benigne courtesy\nMake them good cheer, and busily espy\nTidings of sundry regnes, for to lear\nThe wonders that they mighte see or hear.\n\nAmonges other thinges, specially\nThese merchants have him told of Dame Constance\nSo great nobless, in earnest so royally,\nThat this Soudan hath caught so great pleasance\nTo have her figure in his remembrance,\nThat all his lust, and all his busy cure,\nWas for to love her while his life may dure.\n\nParaventure in thilke large book,\nWhich that men call the heaven, y-written was\nWith starres, when that he his birthe took,\nThat he for love should have his death, alas!\nFor in the starres, clearer than is glass,\nIs written, God wot, whoso could it read,\nThe death of every man withoute dread.\n\nIn starres many a winter therebeforn\nWas writ the death of Hector, Achilles,\nOf Pompey, Julius, ere they were born;\nThe strife of Thebes; and of Hercules,\nOf Samson, Turnus, and of Socrates\nThe death; but mennes wittes be so dull,\nThat no wight can well read it at the full.\n\nThis Soudan for his privy council sent,\nAnd, shortly of this matter for to pace,\nHe hath to them declared his intent,\nAnd told them certain, but he might have grace\nTo have Constance, within a little space,\nHe was but dead; and charged them in hie\nTo shape for his life some remedy.\n\nDiverse men diverse thinges said;\nAnd arguments they casten up and down;\nMany a subtle reason forth they laid;\nThey speak of magic, and abusion;\nBut finally, as in conclusion,\nThey cannot see in that none avantage,\nNor in no other way, save marriage.\n\nThen saw they therein such difficulty\nBy way of reason, for to speak all plain,\nBecause that there was such diversity\nBetween their bothe lawes, that they sayn,\nThey trowe that no Christian prince would fain\nWedden his child under our lawe sweet,\nThat us was given by Mahound our prophete.\n\nAnd he answered: \"Rather than I lose\nConstance, I will be christen'd doubteless\nI must be hers, I may none other choose,\nI pray you hold your arguments in peace,\nSave my life, and be not reckeless\nTo gette her that hath my life in cure,\nFor in this woe I may not long endure.\"\n\nWhat needeth greater dilatation?\nI say, by treaty and ambassadry,\nAnd by the Pope's mediation,\nAnd all the Church, and all the chivalry,\nThat in destruction of Mah'metry,\nAnd in increase of Christe's lawe dear,\nThey be accorded so as ye may hear;\n\nHow that the Soudan, and his baronage,\nAnd all his lieges, shall y-christen'd be,\nAnd he shall have Constance in

no man tellen in a little clause,\nAs was arrayed for so high a cause.\n\nBishops be shapen with her for to wend,\nLordes, ladies, and knightes of renown,\nAnd other folk enough, this is the end.\nAnd notified is throughout all the town,\nThat every wight with great devotioun\nShould pray to Christ, that he this marriage\nReceive in gree, and speede this voyage.\n\nThe day is comen of her departing, --\nI say the woful fatal day is come,\nThat there may be no longer tarrying,\nBut forward they them dressen all and some.\nConstance, that was with sorrow all o'ercome,\nFull pale arose, and dressed her to wend,\nFor well she saw there was no other end.\n\nAlas! what wonder is it though she wept,\nThat shall be sent to a strange nation\nFrom friendes, that so tenderly her kept,\nAnd to be bound under subjection\nof one, she knew not his condition?\nHusbands be all good, and have been of yore,\nThat knowe wives; I dare say no more.\n\n\"Father,\" she said, \"thy wretched child

circumstance:\n\"Now Jesus Christ be with you all,\" she said.\nThere is no more,but \"Farewell, fair Constance.\"\nShe pained her to make good countenance.\nAnd forth I let her sail in this manner,\nAnd turn I will again to my matter.\n\nThe mother of the Soudan, well of vices,\nEspied hath her sone's plain intent,\nHow he will leave his olde sacrifices:\nAnd right anon she for her council sent,\nAnd they be come, to knowe what she meant,\nAnd when assembled was this folk in fere,\nShe sat her down, and said as ye shall hear.\n\n\"Lordes,\" she said, \"ye knowen every one,\nHow

I in this tale longer tarry?\nShe rode unto the Soudan on a day,\nAnd said him, that she would reny her lay,\nAnd Christendom of priestes' handes fong,\nRepenting her she heathen was so long;\n\nBeseeching him to do her that honour,\nThat she might have the Christian folk to feast:\n\"To please them I will do my labour.\"\nThe Soudan said, \"I will do at your hest,\"\nAnd kneeling, thanked her for that request;\nSo glad he was, he wist not what to say.\nShe kiss'd her son, and home she went her way.\n\nArrived be these Christian folk to land\nIn Syria, with a great solemne rout,\nAnd hastily this Soudan sent his sond,\nFirst to his mother, and all the realm about,\nAnd said, his wife was comen out of doubt,\nAnd pray'd them for to ride again the queen,\nThe honour of his regne to sustene.\n\nGreat was the press, and rich was the array\nOf Syrians and Romans met in fere.\nThe mother of the Soudan rich and gay\nReceived her with all so glad a cheer\nAs any mother might her daughter dear\nAnd to the nexte city there beside\nA softe pace solemnely they ride.\n\nNought, trow I, the triumph of Julius\nOf which that Lucan maketh such a boast,\nWas royaller, or more curious,\nThan was th' assembly of this blissful host\nBut O this scorpion, this wicked ghost,\nThe Soudaness, for all her flattering\nCast under this full mortally to sting.\n\nThe Soudan came himself soon after this,\nSo royally, that wonder is to tell,\nAnd welcomed her with all joy and bliss.\nAnd thus in mirth and joy I let them dwell.\nThe fruit of his matter is that I tell;\nWhen the time came, men thought it for the best\nThat revel stint, and men go to their rest.\n\nThe time is come that this old Soudaness\nOrdained hath the feast of which I told,\nAnd to the feast the

is\nTo manne's wit, that for our, ignorance\nNe cannot know his prudent purveyance.\n\nNow since she was not at the feast y-slaw,\nWho kepte her from drowning in the sea?\nWho kepte Jonas in the fish's maw,\nTill he was spouted up at Nineveh?\nWell may men know, it was no wight but he\nThat kept the Hebrew people from drowning,\nWith drye feet throughout the sea passing.\n\nWho bade the foure spirits of tempest,\nThat power have t' annoye land and sea,\nBoth north and south, and also west and east,\nAnnoye neither sea, nor land, nor tree?\nSoothly the commander of that was he\nThat from the tempest aye this woman kept,\nAs well when she awoke as when she slept.\n\nWhere might this woman meat and drinke have?\nThree year and more how lasted her vitaille?\nWho fed the Egyptian Mary in the cave\nOr in desert? no wight but Christ sans faille.\nFive thousand folk it was as great marvaille\nWith loaves five and fishes two to feed\nGod sent his foison at her greate need.\n\nShe drived forth into our ocean\nThroughout our wilde sea, till at the last\nUnder an hold, that nempnen I not can,\nFar in Northumberland, the wave her cast\nAnd in the sand her ship sticked so fast\nThat thennes would it not in all a tide:\nThe will of Christ was that she should abide.\n\nThe Constable of the castle down did fare\nTo see this wreck, and all the ship he sought,\nAnd found this weary woman full of care;\nHe found also the treasure that she brought:\nIn her language mercy she besought,\nThe life out of her body for to twin,\nHer to deliver of woe that she was in.\n\nA manner Latin corrupt  was her speech,\nBut algate thereby was she understond.\nThe Constable, when him list no longer seech,\nThis woeful woman brought he to the lond.\nShe kneeled down, and thanked Godde's sond;\nBut what she was she would to no man say\nFor foul nor fair, although that she should dey.\n\nShe said, she was so mazed in the sea,\nThat she forgot her minde, by her truth.\nThe Constable had of her so great pity\nAnd eke his wife, that they wept for ruth:\nShe was so diligent withoute slouth\nTo serve and please every one in that place,\nThat all her lov'd, that looked in her face.\n\nThe Constable and Dame Hermegild his wife\nWere Pagans, and that country every where;\nBut Hermegild lov'd Constance as her life;\nAnd Constance had so long sojourned there\nIn orisons, with many a bitter tear,\nTill Jesus had converted through His grace\nDame Hermegild, Constabless of that place.\n\nIn all that land no Christians durste rout;\nAll Christian folk had fled from that country\nThrough Pagans, that conquered all about\nThe plages of the North by land and sea.\nTo Wales had fled the Christianity\nOf olde Britons, dwelling in this isle;\nThere was their refuge for the meanewhile.\n\nBut yet n'ere Christian Britons so exiled,\nThat there n'ere some which in their privity\nHonoured Christ, and heathen folk beguiled;\nAnd nigh the castle such there dwelled three:\nAnd one of them was blind, and might not see,\nBut it were with thilk eyen of his mind,\nWith which men maye see when they be blind.\n\nBright was the sun, as in a summer's day,\nFor which the Constable, and his wife also,\nAnd Constance, have y-take the righte way\nToward the sea a furlong way or two,\nTo playen, and to roame to and fro;\nAnd in their walk this blinde man they met,\nCrooked and old, with eyen fast y-shet.\n\n\"In the name of Christ,\" cried this blind Briton,\n\"Dame Hermegild, give me my sight again!\"\nThis lady wax'd afrayed of that soun',\nLest that her husband, shortly for to sayn,\nWould her for Jesus Christe's love have slain,\nTill Constance made her hold, and bade her wirch\nThe will of Christ, as daughter of holy Church\n\nThe Constable wax'd abashed of that sight,\nAnd saide; \"What amounteth all this fare?\"\nConstance answered; \"Sir, it is Christ's might,\nThat helpeth folk out of the fiendes snare:\"\nAnd so farforth she gan our law declare,\nThat she the Constable, ere that it were eve,\nConverted, and on Christ made him believe.\n\nThis Constable was not lord of the place\nOf which I speak, there as he Constance fand,\nBut kept it strongly many a winter space,\nUnder Alla, king of Northumberland,\nThat was full wise, and worthy of his hand\nAgainst the Scotes, as men may well hear;\nBut turn I will again to my mattere.\n\nSatan, that ever us waiteth to beguile,\nSaw of Constance all her perfectioun,\nAnd cast anon how he might quite her while;\nAnd made a young knight, that dwelt in that town,\nLove her so hot of foul affectioun,\nThat verily him thought that he should spill\nBut he of her might ones have his will.\n\nHe wooed her, but it availed nought;\nShe woulde do no sinne by no way:\nAnd for despite, he compassed his thought\nTo make her a shameful death to dey;\nHe waiteth when the Constable is away,\nAnd privily upon a night he crept\nIn Hermegilda's chamber while she slept.\n\nWeary, forwaked in her orisons,\nSleepeth Constance, and Hermegild also.\nThis knight, through Satanas' temptation;\nAll softetly is to the bed y-go,\nAnd cut the throat of Hermegild in two,\nAnd laid the bloody knife by Dame Constance,\nAnd went his way, there God give him mischance.\n\nSoon after came the Constable home again,\nAnd eke Alla that king was of that land,\nAnd saw his wife dispiteously slain,\nFor which full oft he wept and wrung his hand;\nAnd ill the bed the bloody knife he fand\nBy Dame Constance: Alas! what might she say?\nFor very woe her wit was all away.\n\nTo King Alla was told all this mischance\nAnd eke the time, and where, and in what wise\nThat in a ship was founden this Constance,\nAs here before ye have me heard devise:\nThe kinges heart for pity gan agrise,\nWhen he saw so benign a creature\nFall in disease and in misaventure.\n\nFor as the lamb toward his death is brought,\nSo stood this innocent before the king:\nThis false knight, that had this treason wrought,\nBore her in hand that she had done this thing:\nBut natheless there was great murmuring\nAmong the people, that say they cannot guess\nThat she had done so great a wickedness.\n\nFor they had seen her ever virtuous,\nAnd loving Hermegild right as her life:\nOf this bare witness each one in that house,\nSave he that Hermegild slew with his knife:\nThis gentle king had caught a great motife\nOf this witness, and thought he would inquere\nDeeper into this case, the truth to lear.\n\nAlas! Constance, thou has no champion,\nNor fighte canst thou not, so well-away!\nBut he that starf for our redemption,\nAnd bound Satan, and yet li'th where he lay,\nSo be thy stronge champion this day:\nFor, but Christ upon thee miracle kithe,\nWithoute guilt thou shalt be slain as swithe.\n\nShe set her down on knees, and thus she said;\n\"Immortal God, that savedest Susanne\nFrom false blame; and thou merciful maid,\nMary I mean, the daughter to Saint Anne,\nBefore whose child the angels sing Osanne,\nIf I be guiltless of this felony,\nMy succour be, or elles shall I die.\"\n\nHave ye not seen sometime a pale face\n(Among a press) of him that hath been lad\nToward his death, where he getteth no grace,\nAnd such a colour in his face hath had,\nMen mighte know him that was so bestad\nAmonges all the faces in that rout?\nSo stood Constance, and looked her about.\n\nO queenes living in prosperity,\nDuchesses, and ye ladies every one,\nHave some ruth on her adversity!\nAn emperor's daughter, she stood alone;\nShe had no wight to whom to make her moan.\nO blood royal, that standest in this drede,\nFar be thy friendes in thy greate need!\n\nThis king Alla had such compassioun,\nAs gentle heart is full filled of pity,\nThat from his eyen ran the water down\n\"Now hastily do fetch a book,\" quoth he;\n\"And if this knight will sweare, how that she\nThis woman slew, yet will we us advise\nWhom that we will that shall be our justice.\"\n\nA Briton book, written with Evangiles,\nWas  fetched, and on this book he swore anon\nShe guilty was; and, in the meanewhiles,\nAn hand him smote upon the necke bone,\nThat down he fell at once right as a stone:\nAnd both his eyen burst out of his face\nIn sight of ev'rybody in that place.\n\nA voice was heard, in general audience,\nThat said; \"Thou hast deslander'd guilteless\nThe daughter of holy Church in high presence;\nThus hast thou done, and yet hold I my peace?\"\nOf this marvel aghast was all the press,\nAs mazed folk they stood every one\nFor dread of wreake, save Constance alone.\n\nGreat was the dread and eke the repentance\nOf them that hadde wrong suspicion\nUpon this sely innocent Constance;\nAnd for this miracle, in conclusion,\nAnd by Constance's mediation,\nThe king, and many another in that place,\nConverted was, thanked be Christe's grace!\n\nThis false knight was slain for his untruth\nBy judgement of Alla hastily;\nAnd yet Constance had of his death great ruth;\nAnd after this Jesus of his mercy\nMade Alla wedde full solemnely\nThis holy woman, that is so bright and sheen,\nAnd thus hath Christ y-made Constance a queen.\n\nBut who was woeful, if I shall not lie,\nOf this wedding but Donegild, and no mo',\nThe kinge's mother, full of tyranny?\nHer thought her cursed heart would burst in two;\nShe would not that her son had done so;\nHer thought it a despite that he should take\nSo strange a creature unto his make.\n\nMe list not of the chaff nor of the stre\nMake so long a tale, as of the corn.\nWhat should I tellen of the royalty\nOf this marriage, or which course goes beforn,\nWho bloweth in a trump or in an horn?\nThe fruit of every tale is for to say;\nThey eat and drink, and dance, and sing, and play.\n\nThey go to bed, as it was skill and right;\nFor though that wives be full holy things,\nThey muste take in patience at night\nSuch manner necessaries as be pleasings\nTo folk that have y-wedded them with rings,\nAnd lay a lite their holiness aside\nAs for the time, it may no better betide.\n\nOn her he got a knave child anon,\nAnd to a Bishop and to his Constable eke\nHe took his wife to keep, when he is gone\nTo Scotland-ward, his foemen for to seek.\nNow fair Constance, that is so humble and meek,\nSo long is gone with childe till that still\nShe held her chamb'r, abiding Christe's will\n\nThe time is come, a knave child she bare;\nMauricius at the font-stone they him call.\nThis Constable doth forth come a messenger,\nAnd wrote unto his king that clep'd was All',\nHow that this blissful tiding is befall,\nAnd other tidings speedful for to say\nHe hath the letter, and forth he go'th his way.\n\nThis messenger, to do his avantage,\nUnto the kinge's mother rideth swithe,\nAnd saluteth her full fair in his language.\n\"Madame,\" quoth he, \"ye may be glad and blithe,\nAnd thanke God an hundred thousand sithe;\nMy lady queen hath child, withoute doubt,\nTo joy and bliss of all this realm about.\n\n\"Lo, here the letter sealed of this thing,\nThat I must bear with all the haste I may:\nIf ye will aught unto your son the king,\nI am your servant both by night and day.\"\nDonegild answer'd, \"As now at this time, nay;\nBut here I will all night thou take thy rest,\nTo-morrow will I say thee what me lest.\"\n\nThis messenger drank sadly ale and wine,\nAnd stolen were his letters privily\nOut of his box, while he slept as a swine;\nAnd counterfeited was full subtilly\nAnother letter, wrote full sinfully,\nUnto the king, direct of this mattere\nFrom his Constable, as ye shall after hear.\n\nThis letter said, the queen deliver'd was\nOf so horrible a fiendlike creature,\nThat in the castle none so hardy was\nThat any while he durst therein endure:\nThe mother was an elf by aventure\nBecome, by charmes or by sorcery,\nAnd every man hated her company.\n\nWoe was this king when he this letter had seen,\nBut to no wight he told his sorrows sore,\nBut with his owen hand he wrote again,\n\"Welcome the sond of Christ for evermore\nTo me, that am now learned in this lore:\nLord, welcome be thy lust and thy pleasance,\nMy lust I put all in thine ordinance.\n\n\"Keepe this child, albeit foul or fair,\nAnd eke my wife, unto mine homecoming:\nChrist when him list may send to me an heir\nMore agreeable than this to my liking.\"\nThis letter he sealed, privily weeping.\nWhich to the messenger was taken soon,\nAnd forth he went, there is no more to do'n.\n\nO messenger full fill'd of drunkenness,\nStrong is thy breath, thy limbes falter aye,\nAnd thou betrayest alle secretness;\nThy mind is lorn, thou janglest as a jay;\nThy face is turned in a new array;\nWhere drunkenness reigneth in any rout,\nThere is no counsel hid, withoute doubt.\n\nO Donegild, I have no English dign\nUnto thy malice, and thy tyranny:\nAnd therefore to the fiend I thee resign,\nLet him indite of all thy treachery\n'Fy, mannish, fy!

what is thy guilt,\nThat never wroughtest sin as yet, pardie?\nWhy will thine harde father have thee spilt?\nO mercy, deare Constable,\" quoth she,\n\"And let my little child here dwell with thee:\nAnd if thou dar'st not save him from blame,\nSo kiss him ones in his father's name.\"\n\nTherewith she looked backward to the land,\nAnd saide, \"Farewell, husband rutheless!\"\nAnd up she rose, and walked down the strand\nToward the ship, her following all the press:\nAnd ever she pray'd her child to hold his peace,\nAnd took her leave, and with an holy intent\nShe blessed her, and to the ship she went.\n\nVictualed was the ship, it is no drede,\nAbundantly for her a full long space:\nAnd other necessaries that should need\nShe had enough, heried be Godde's grace:\nFor wind and weather, Almighty God purchase,\nAnd bring her home; I can no better say;\nBut in the sea she drived forth her way.\n\nAlla the king came home soon after this\nUnto the castle, of the which I told,\nAnd asked where his wife and his child is;\nThe Constable gan about his heart feel cold,\nAnd plainly all the matter he him told\nAs ye have heard; I can tell it no better;\nAnd shew'd the king his seal, and eke his letter\n\nAnd saide; \"Lord, as ye commanded me\nOn pain of death, so have I done certain.\"\nThe messenger tormented was, till he\nMuste beknow, and tell it flat and plain,\nFrom night to night in what place he had lain;\nAnd thus, by wit and subtle inquiring,\nImagin'd was by whom this harm gan spring.\n\nThe hand was known that had the letter wrote,\nAnd all the venom of the cursed deed;\nBut in what wise, certainly I know not.\nTh' effect is this, that Alla, out of drede,\nHis mother slew, that may men plainly read,\nFor that she traitor was to her liegeance:\nThus ended olde Donegild with mischance.\n\nThe sorrow that this Alla night and day\nMade for his wife, and for his child also,\nThere is no tongue that it telle may.\nBut now will I again to Constance go,\nThat floated in the sea in pain and woe\nFive year and more, as liked Christe's sond,\nEre that her ship approached to the lond.\n\nUnder an heathen castle, at the last,\nOf which the name in my text I not find,\nConstance and eke her child the sea upcast.\nAlmighty God, that saved all mankind,\nHave on Constance and on her child some mind,\nThat fallen is in heathen hand eftsoon\nIn point to spill, as I shall tell you soon!\n\nDown from the castle came there many a wight\nTo gauren on this ship, and on Constance:\nBut shortly from the castle, on a night,\nThe lorde's steward, -- God give him mischance, --\nA thief that had renied our creance,\nCame to the ship alone, and said he would\nHer leman be, whether she would or n'ould.\n\nWoe was this wretched woman then begone;\nHer child cri'd, and she cried piteously:\nBut blissful Mary help'd her right anon,\nFor, with her struggling well and mightily,\nThe thief fell overboard all suddenly,\nAnd in the sea he drenched for vengeance,\nAnd thus hath Christ unwemmed kept Constance.\n\nO foul lust of luxury! lo thine end!\nNot only that thou faintest manne's mind,\nBut verily thou wilt his body shend.\nTh' end of thy work, or of thy lustes blind,\nIs complaining: how many may men find,\nThat not for work, sometimes, but for th' intent\nTo do this sin, be either slain or shent?\n\nHow may this weake woman have the strength\nHer to defend against this renegate?\nO Goliath, unmeasurable of length,\nHow mighte David make thee so mate?\nSo young, and of armour so desolate,\nHow durst he look upon thy dreadful face?\nWell may men see it was but Godde's grace.\n\nWho gave Judith courage or hardiness\nTo slay him, Holofernes, in his tent,\nAnd to deliver out of wretchedness\nThe people of God? I say for this intent\nThat right as God spirit of vigour sent\nTo them, and saved them out of mischance,\nSo sent he might and vigour to Constance.\n\nForth went her ship throughout the narrow mouth\nOf Jubaltare and Septe, driving alway,\nSometime west, and sometime north and south,\nAnd sometime east, full many a weary day:\nTill Christe's mother (blessed be she aye)\nHad shaped through her endeless goodness\nTo make an end of all her heaviness.\n\nNow let us stint of Constance but a throw,\nAnd speak we of the Roman emperor,\nThat out of Syria had by letters know\nThe slaughter of Christian folk, and dishonor\nDone to his daughter by a false traitor,\nI mean the cursed wicked Soudaness,\nThat at the feast let slay both more and less.\n\nFor which this emperor had sent anon\nHis senator, with royal ordinance,\nAnd other lordes, God wot, many a one,\nOn Syrians to take high vengeance:\nThey burn and slay, and bring them to mischance\nFull many a day: but shortly this is th' end,\nHomeward to Rome they shaped them to wend.\n\nThis senator repaired with victory\nTo Rome-ward, sailing full royally,\nAnd met the ship driving, as saith the story,\nIn which Constance sat full piteously:\nAnd nothing knew he what she was, nor why\nShe was in such array; nor she will say\nOf her estate, although that she should dey.\n\nHe brought her unto Rome, and to his wife\nHe gave her, and her younge son also:\nAnd with the senator she led her life.\nThus can our Lady bringen out of woe\nWoeful Constance, and many another mo':\nAnd longe time she dwelled in that place,\nIn holy works ever, as was her grace.\n\nThe senatores wife her aunte was,\nBut for all that she knew her ne'er the more:\nI will no longer tarry in this case,\nBut to King Alla, whom I spake of yore,\nThat for his wife wept and sighed sore,\nI will return, and leave I will Constance\nUnder the senatores governance.\n\nKing Alla, which that had his mother slain,\nUpon a day fell in such repentance;\nThat, if I shortly tell it shall and plain,\nTo Rome he came to receive his penitance,\nAnd put him in the Pope's ordinance\nIn high and low, and Jesus Christ besought\nForgive his wicked works that he had wrought.\n\nThe fame anon throughout the town is borne,\nHow Alla king shall come on pilgrimage,\nBy harbingers that wente him beforn,\nFor which the senator, as was usage,\nRode him again, and many of his lineage,\nAs well to show his high magnificence,\nAs to do any king a reverence.\n\nGreat cheere did this noble senator\nTo King Alla and he to him also;\nEach of them did the other great honor;\nAnd so befell, that in a day or two\nThis senator did to King Alla go\nTo feast, and shortly, if I shall not lie,\nConstance's son went in his company.\n\nSome men would say, at request of Constance\nThis senator had led this child to feast:\nI may not tellen every circumstance,\nBe as be may, there was he at the least:\nBut sooth is this, that at his mother's hest\nBefore Alla during the meates space,\nThe child stood, looking in the kinges face.\n\nThis Alla king had of this child great wonder,\nAnd to the senator he said anon,\n\"Whose is that faire child that standeth yonder?\"\n\"I n'ot,\" quoth he, \"by God and by Saint John;\nA mother he hath, but father hath he none,\nThat I of wot:\" and shortly in a stound\nHe told to Alla how this child was found.\n\n\"But God wot,\" quoth this senator also,\n\"So virtuous a liver in all my life\nI never saw, as she, nor heard of mo'\nOf worldly woman, maiden, widow or wife:\nI dare well say she hadde lever a knife\nThroughout her breast, than be a woman wick',\nThere is no man could bring her to that prick.\n\nNow was this child as like unto Constance\nAs possible is a creature to be:\nThis Alla had the face in remembrance\nOf Dame Constance, and thereon mused he,\nIf that the childe's mother were aught she\nThat was his wife;

yet grac'd the gallant boy;\nThough few the seasons of his youthful life,\nAs yet a novice in the martial strife,\n'Twas his, with beauty, Valour's gifts to share--\nA soul heroic, as his form was fair:\nThese burn with one pure flame of generous love;\nIn peace, in war, united still they move;\nFriendship and Glory form their joint reward;\nAnd, now, combin'd they hold their nightly guard.\n\n\"What God,\" exclaim'd the first, \"instils this fire?\nOr, in itself a God, what great desire?\nMy lab'ring soul, with anxious thought oppress'd,\nAbhors this station of inglorious

at distance, meet the sight,\nSeen o'er the glade, when not obscur'd by night:\nThen shall Æneas in his pride return,\nWhile hostile matrons raise their offspring's urn;\nAnd Latian spoils, and purpled heaps of dead\nShall mark the havoc of our Hero's tread;\nSuch is our purpose, not unknown the way,\nWhere yonder torrent's devious waters stray;\nOft have we seen, when hunting by the

revive,\nAnd Ilion's wonted glories still survive.\"\nThen in his warm embrace the boys he press'd,\nAnd, quivering, strain'd them to his agéd breast;\nWith tears the burning cheek of each bedew'd,\nAnd, sobbing, thus his first discourse renew'd:--\n\"What gift, my countrymen, what martial prize,\nCan we bestow, which you may not despise?\nOur Deities the first best boon have given--\nInternal virtues are the gift of Heaven.\nWhat poor rewards can bless your deeds on earth,\nDoubtless await such young, exalted worth;\nÆneas and Ascanius shall combine\nTo yield applause far, far surpassing mine.\"\n\n  Iulus then:--\"By all the powers above!\nBy those Penates, who my country love!\nBy hoary Vesta's sacred Fane, I swear,\nMy hopes are all in you, ye generous pair!\nRestore my father, to my grateful sight,\nAnd all my sorrows, yield to one delight.\nNisus! two silver goblets are thine own,\nSav'd from Arisba's stately domes o'erthrown;\nMy sire secured

gave,\nWhile yet our vessels press'd the Punic wave:\nBut when the hostile chiefs at length bow down,\nWhen great Æneas wears Hesperia's crown,\nThe casque, the buckler, and the fiery steed\nWhich Turnus guides with more than mortal speed,\nAre thine; no envious lot shall then be cast,\nI pledge my word, irrevocably past:\nNay more, twelve slaves, and twice six captive dames,\nTo soothe thy softer hours with amorous flames,\nAnd all the realms, which now the Latins sway,\nThe labours of to-night shall well repay.\nBut thou, my generous youth, whose tender years\nAre near my own, whose worth my heart reveres,\nHenceforth, affection, sweetly thus begun,\nShall join our bosoms and our souls in one;\nWithout thy aid, no glory shall be mine,\nWithout thy dear advice, no great design;\nAlike, through life, esteem'd, thou godlike boy,\nIn war my bulwark, and in peace my joy.\"\n\n  To him Euryalus:--\"No day shall shame\nThe rising glories which from this I claim.\nFortune

royal line,\nLike thine ennobled, hardly less divine,\nNor Troy nor king Acestes' realms restrain\nHer feeble age from dangers of the main;\nAlone she came, all selfish fears above,\nA bright example of maternal love.\nUnknown, the secret enterprise I brave,\nLest grief should bend my parent to the grave;\nFrom this alone no fond adieus I seek,\nNo fainting mother's lips have press'd my cheek;\nBy gloomy Night and thy right hand I vow,\nHer parting tears would shake my purpose now:\nDo thou, my prince, her failing age sustain,\nIn thee her much-lov'd child may live again;\nHer dying hours with pious conduct bless,\nAssist her wants, relieve her fond distress:\nSo dear a hope must all my soul enflame,\nTo rise in glory, or to fall in fame.\"\nStruck with a filial care so deeply felt,\nIn tears at once the Trojan warriors melt;\nFaster than all, Iulus' eyes o'erflow!\nSuch love was his, and such had been his woe.\n\"All thou hast ask'd, receive,\" the Prince replied;\n\"Nor this alone, but many a gift beside.\nTo cheer thy mother's years shall be my aim,\nCreusa's style but wanting to the dame;\nFortune an adverse wayward course may run,\nBut bless'd thy mother in so dear a son.\nNow, by my life!--my Sire's most sacred oath--\nTo thee I pledge my full, my firmest troth,\nAll the rewards which once to thee were vow'd,\nIf thou should'st fall, on her shall be bestow'd.\"\nThus spoke the weeping Prince, then forth to view\nA gleaming falchion from the sheath he drew;\nLycaon's utmost skill had grac'd the steel,\nFor friends to envy and for foes to feel:\nA tawny hide, the Moorish lion's spoil,\nSlain 'midst the forest in the hunter's toil,\nMnestheus to guard the elder youth bestows,\nAnd old Alethes' casque defends his brows;\nArm'd, thence they go, while all th' assembl'd train,\nTo aid their cause, implore the gods in vain.\nMore than a boy, in wisdom and in grace,\nIulus holds amidst the chiefs his place:\nHis prayer he sends; but what can prayers avail,\nLost in the murmurs of the sighing gale?\n\n  The trench is pass'd, and favour'd by the night,\nThrough sleeping foes, they wheel their wary flight.\nWhen shall the sleep of many a foe be o'er?\nAlas! some slumber, who shall wake no more!\nChariots and bridles, mix'd with arms, are seen,\nAnd flowing flasks, and scatter'd troops between:\nBacchus and Mars, to rule the camp, combine;\nA mingled Chaos this of war and wine.\n\"Now,\" cries the first, \"for deeds of blood prepare,\nWith me the conquest and the labour share:\nHere lies our path; lest any hand arise,\nWatch thou, while many a dreaming chieftain dies;\nI'll carve our passage, through the heedless foe,\nAnd clear thy road, with many a deadly blow.\"\nHis whispering accents then the youth repress'd,\nAnd pierced proud Rhamnes through his panting breast:\nStretch'd at his ease, th' incautious king repos'd;\nDebauch, and not fatigue, his eyes had clos'd;\nTo Turnus dear, a prophet and a prince,\nHis omens more than augur's skill evince;\nBut he, who thus foretold the fate of all,\nCould not avert his own untimely fall.\nNext Remus' armour-bearer, hapless, fell,\nAnd three unhappy slaves the carnage swell;\nThe charioteer along his courser's sides\nExpires, the steel his sever'd neck divides;\nAnd, last, his Lord is number'd with the dead:\nBounding convulsive, flies the gasping head;\nFrom the swol'n veins the blackening torrents pour;\nStain'd is the couch and earth with clotting gore.\nYoung Lamyrus and Lamus next expire,\nAnd gay Serranus, fill'd with youthful fire;\nHalf the long night in childish games was pass'd;\nLull'd by the potent grape, he slept at last:\nAh! happier far, had he the morn survey'd,\nAnd, till Aurora's dawn, his skill display'd.\nIn slaughter'd folds, the keepers lost in sleep,\nHis hungry fangs a lion thus may steep;\n'Mid the sad flock, at dead of night he prowls,\nWith murder glutted, and in carnage rolls\nInsatiate still, through teeming herds he roams;\nIn seas of gore, the lordly tyrant foams.\n\n  Nor less the other's deadly vengeance came,\nBut falls on feeble crowds without a name;\nHis wound unconscious Fadus scarce can feel,\nYet wakeful Rhæsus sees the threatening steel;\nHis coward breast behind a jar he hides,\nAnd, vainly, in the weak defence confides;\nFull in his heart, the falchion search'd his veins,\nThe reeking weapon bears alternate stains;\nThrough wine and blood, commingling as they flow,\nOne feeble spirit seeks the shades below.\nNow where Messapus dwelt they bend their way,\nWhose fires emit a faint and trembling ray;\nThere, unconfin'd, behold each grazing steed,\nUnwatch'd, unheeded, on the herbage feed:\nBrave Nisus here arrests his comrade's arm,\nToo flush'd with carnage, and with conquest warm:\n\"Hence let us haste, the dangerous path is pass'd;\nFull foes enough, to-night, have breath'd their last:\nSoon will the Day those Eastern clouds adorn;\nNow let us speed, nor tempt the rising morn.\"\n\n  What silver arms, with various art emboss'd,\nWhat bowls and mantles, in confusion toss'd,\nThey leave regardless! yet one glittering prize\nAttracts the younger Hero's wandering eyes;\nThe gilded harness Rhamnes' coursers felt,\nThe gems which stud the monarch's golden belt:\nThis from the pallid corse was quickly torn,\nOnce by a line of former chieftains worn.\nTh' exulting boy the studded girdle wears,\nMessapus' helm his head, in triumph, bears;\nThen from the tents their cautious steps they bend,\nTo seek the vale, where safer paths extend.\n\n  Just at this hour, a band of Latian horse\nTo Turnus' camp pursue their destin'd course:\nWhile the slow foot their tardy march delay,\nThe knights, impatient, spur along the way:\nThree hundred mail-clad men, by Volscens led,\nTo Turnus with their master's promise sped:\nNow they approach the trench, and view the walls,\nWhen, on the left, a light reflection falls;\nThe plunder'd helmet, through the waning night,\nSheds forth a silver radiance, glancing bright;\nVolscens, with question loud, the pair alarms:--\n\"Stand, Stragglers! stand! why early thus in arms?\nFrom whence? to whom?\"--He meets with no reply;\nTrusting the covert of the night, they fly:\nThe thicket's depth, with hurried pace, they tread,\nWhile round the wood the hostile squadron spread.\n\n  With brakes entangled, scarce a path between,\nDreary and dark appears the sylvan scene:\nEuryalus his heavy spoils impede,\nThe boughs and winding turns his steps mislead;\nBut Nisus scours along the forest's maze,\nTo where Latinus' steeds in safety graze,\nThen backward o'er the plain his eyes extend,\nOn every side they seek his absent friend.\n\"O God! my boy,\" he cries, \"of me bereft,\nIn what impending perils art thou left!\"\nListening he runs--above the waving trees,\nTumultuous voices swell the passing breeze;\nThe war-cry rises, thundering hoofs around\nWake the dark echoes of the trembling ground.\nAgain he turns--of footsteps hears the noise--\nThe sound elates--the sight his hope destroys:\nThe hapless boy a ruffian train surround,\nWhile lengthening shades his weary way confound;\nHim, with loud shouts, the furious knights pursue,\nStruggling in vain, a captive to the crew.\nWhat can his friend 'gainst thronging numbers dare?\nAh! must he rush, his comrade's fate to share?\nWhat force, what aid, what stratagem essay,\nBack to redeem the Latian spoiler's prey?\nHis life a votive ransom nobly give,\nOr die with him, for whom he wish'd to live?\nPoising with strength his lifted lance on high,\nOn Luna's orb he cast his frenzied eye:--\n\n\"Goddess serene, transcending every star!\nQueen of the sky, whose beams are seen afar!\nBy night Heaven owns thy sway, by day the grove,\nWhen, as chaste Dian, here thou deign'st to rove;\nIf e'er myself, or Sire, have sought to grace\nThine altars, with the produce of the chase,\nSpeed, speed my dart to pierce yon vaunting crowd,\nTo free my friend, and scatter far the proud.\"\nThus having said, the hissing dart he flung;\nThrough parted shades the hurtling weapon sung;\nThe thirsty point in Sulmo's entrails lay,\nTransfix'd his heart, and stretch'd him on the clay:\nHe sobs, he dies,--the troop in wild amaze,\nUnconscious whence the death, with horror gaze;\nWhile pale they stare, thro' Tagus' temples riven,\nA second shaft, with equal force is driven:\nFierce Volscens rolls around his lowering eyes;\nVeil'd by the night, secure the Trojan lies.\nBurning with wrath, he view'd his soldiers fall.\n\"Thou youth accurst, thy life shall pay for all!\"\nQuick from the sheath his flaming glaive he drew,\nAnd, raging, on the boy defenceless flew.\nNisus, no more the blackening shade conceals,\nForth, forth he starts, and all his love reveals;\nAghast, confus'd, his fears to madness rise,\nAnd pour these accents, shrieking as he flies;\n\"Me, me,--your vengeance hurl on me alone;\nHere sheathe the steel, my blood is all your own;\nYe starry Spheres! thou conscious Heaven! attest!\nHe could not--durst not--lo! the guile confest!\nAll, all was mine,--his early fate suspend;\nHe only lov'd, too well, his hapless friend:\nSpare, spare, ye Chiefs! from him your rage remove;\nHis fault was friendship, all his crime was love.\"\nHe pray'd in vain; the dark assassin's sword\nPierced the fair side, the snowy bosom gor'd;\nLowly to earth inclines his plume-clad crest,\nAnd sanguine torrents mantle o'er his breast:\nAs some young rose whose blossom scents the air,\nLanguid in death, expires beneath the share;\nOr crimson poppy, sinking with the shower,\nDeclining gently, falls a fading flower;\nThus, sweetly drooping, bends his lovely head,\nAnd lingering Beauty hovers round the dead.\n\nBut fiery Nisus stems the battle's tide,\nRevenge his leader, and Despair his guide;\nVolscens he seeks amidst the gathering host,\nVolscens must soon appease his comrade's ghost;\nSteel, flashing, pours on steel, foe crowds on foe;\nRage nerves his arm, Fate gleams in every blow;\nIn vain beneath unnumber'd wounds he bleeds,\nNor wounds, nor death, distracted Nisus heeds;\nIn viewless circles wheel'd his falchion flies,\nNor quits the hero's grasp till Volscens dies;\nDeep in his throat its end the weapon found,\nThe tyrant's soul fled groaning through the wound.\nThus Nisus all his fond affection prov'd--\nDying, revenged the fate of him he lov'd;\nThen on his bosom sought his wonted place,\nAnd death was heavenly, in his friend's embrace!\n\nCelestial pair! if aught my verse can claim,\nWafted on Time's broad pinion, yours is fame!\nAges on ages shall your fate admire,\nNo future day shall see your names expire,\nWhile stands the Capitol, immortal

Age dwells on their remembrance through the\nmist of time. In the twilight he recalls the sunny hours of morn. He\nlifts his spear with trembling hand. \"Not thus feebly did I raise the\nsteel before my fathers!\" Past is the race of heroes! But their fame\nrises on the harp; their souls ride on the wings of the wind; they hear\nthe sound through the sighs of the storm, and rejoice in their hall of\nclouds. Such is Calmar. The grey stone marks his narrow house. He looks\ndown from eddying tempests: he rolls his form in the whirlwind, and\nhovers on the blast of the mountain.\n\nIn Morven dwelt the Chief; a beam of war to Fingal. His steps in the\nfield were marked in blood. Lochlin's sons had fled before his angry\nspear; but mild was the eye of Calmar; soft was the flow of his\nyellow locks: they streamed like the meteor of the night. No maid was\nthe sigh of his soul: his thoughts were given to friendship,--to\ndark-haired Orla, destroyer of heroes! Equal were their swords in\nbattle; but fierce was the pride of Orla:--gentle alone to Calmar.\nTogether they dwelt in the cave of Oithona.\n\nFrom Lochlin, Swaran bounded o'er the blue waves. Erin's sons fell\nbeneath his might. Fingal roused his chiefs to combat. Their ships\ncover the ocean! Their hosts throng on the green hills. They come to the\naid of Erin.\n\nNight rose in clouds. Darkness veils the armies. But the blazing oaks\ngleam through the valley. The sons of Lochlin slept: their dreams\nwere of blood. They lift the spear in thought, and Fingal flies. Not so\nthe Host of Morven. To watch was the post of Orla. Calmar stood by his\nside. Their spears were in their hands. Fingal called his chiefs: they\nstood around. The king was in the midst. Grey were his locks, but strong\nwas the arm of the king. Age withered not his powers. \"Sons of Morven,\"\nsaid the hero, \"to-morrow we meet the foe. But where is Cuthullin, the\nshield of Erin? He rests in the halls of Tura; he knows not of our\ncoming. Who will speed through Lochlin, to the hero, and call the chief\nto arms? The path is by the swords of foes; but many are my heroes. They\nare thunderbolts of war. Speak, ye chiefs! Who will arise?\"\n\n\"Son of Trenmor! mine be the deed,\" said dark-haired Orla, \"and mine\nalone. What is death to me? I love the sleep of the mighty, but little\nis the danger. The sons of Lochlin dream. I will seek car-borne\nCuthullin. If I fall, raise the song of bards; and lay me by the stream\nof Lubar.\"--\"And shalt thou fall alone?\" said fair-haired Calmar. \"Wilt\nthou leave thy friend afar? Chief of Oithona! not feeble is my arm in\nfight. Could I see thee die, and not lift the spear? No, Orla! ours has\nbeen the chase of the roebuck, and the feast of shells; ours be the path\nof danger: ours has been the cave of Oithona; ours be the narrow\ndwelling on the banks of Lubar.\"--\"Calmar,\" said the chief of Oithona,\n\"why should thy yellow locks be darkened in the dust of Erin? Let me\nfall alone. My father dwells in his hall of air: he will rejoice in his\nboy; but the blue-eyed Mora spreads the feast for her Son in Morven. She\nlistens to the steps of the hunter on the heath, and thinks it is the\ntread of Calmar. Let her not say, 'Calmar has fallen by the steel of\nLochlin: he died with gloomy Orla, the chief of the dark brow.' Why\nshould tears dim the azure eye of Mora? Why should her voice curse Orla,\nthe destroyer of Calmar? Live Calmar! Live to raise my stone of moss;\nlive to revenge me in the blood of Lochlin. Join the song of bards above\nmy grave. Sweet will be the song of Death to Orla, from the voice of\nCalmar. My ghost shall smile on the notes of Praise.\" \"Orla,\" said the\nson of Mora, \"could I raise the song of Death to my friend? Could I give\nhis fame to the winds? No, my heart would speak in sighs: faint and\nbroken are the sounds of sorrow. Orla! our souls shall hear the song\ntogether. One cloud shall be ours on high: the bards will mingle the\nnames of Orla and Calmar.\"\n\nThey quit the circle of the Chiefs. Their steps are to the Host of\nLochlin. The dying blaze of oak dim-twinkles through the night. The\nnorthern star points the path to Tura. Swaran, the King, rests on his\nlonely hill. Here the troops are mixed: they frown in sleep; their\nshields beneath their heads. Their swords gleam, at distance in heaps.\nThe fires are faint; their embers fail in smoke. All is hushed; but the\ngale sighs on the rocks above. Lightly wheel the Heroes through the\nslumbering band. Half the journey is past, when Mathon, resting on his\nshield, meets the eye of Orla. It rolls in flame, and glistens through\nthe shade. His spear is raised on high. \"Why dost thou bend thy brow,\nchief of Oithona?\" said fair-haired Calmar: \"we are in the midst of\nfoes. Is this a time for delay?\" \"It is a time for vengeance,\" said Orla\nof the gloomy brow. \"Mathon of Lochlin sleeps: seest thou his spear? Its\npoint is dim with the gore of my father. The blood of Mathon shall reek\non mine: but shall I slay him sleeping, Son of Mora? No! he shall feel\nhis wound: my fame shall not soar on the blood of slumber. Rise, Mathon,\nrise! The Son of Conna calls; thy life is his; rise to combat.\" Mathon\nstarts from sleep: but did he rise alone? No: the gathering Chiefs bound\non the plain. \"Fly! Calmar, fly!\" said dark-haired Orla. \"Mathon is\nmine. I shall die in joy: but Lochlin crowds around. Fly through the\nshade of night.\" Orla turns. The helm of Mathon is cleft; his shield\nfalls from his arm: he shudders in his blood. He rolls by the side\nof the blazing oak. Strumon sees him fall: his wrath rises: his weapon\nglitters on the head of Orla: but a spear pierced his eye. His brain\ngushes through the wound, and foams on the spear of Calmar. As roll the\nwaves of the Ocean on two mighty barks of the North, so pour the men of\nLochlin on the Chiefs. As, breaking the surge in foam, proudly steer the\nbarks of the North, so rise the Chiefs of Morven on the scattered crests\nof Lochlin. The din of arms came to the ear of Fingal. He strikes his\nshield; his sons throng around; the people pour along the heath. Ryno\nbounds in joy. Ossian stalks in his arms. Oscar shakes the spear. The\neagle wing of Fillan floats on the wind. Dreadful is the clang of death!\nmany are the Widows of Lochlin. Morven prevails in its strength.\n\nMorn glimmers on the hills: no living foe is seen; but the sleepers are\nmany; grim they lie on Erin. The breeze of Ocean lifts their locks; yet\nthey do not awake. The hawks scream above their prey.\n\nWhose yellow locks wave o'er the breast of a chief? Bright as the gold\nof the stranger, they mingle with the dark hair of his friend. 'Tis\nCalmar: he lies on the bosom of Orla. Theirs is one stream of blood.\nFierce is the look of the gloomy Orla. He breathes not; but his eye is\nstill a flame. It glares in death unclosed. His hand is grasped in\nCalmar's; but Calmar lives! he lives, though low. \"Rise,\" said the king,\n\"rise, son of Mora: 'tis mine to heal the wounds of Heroes. Calmar may\nyet bound on the hills of Morven.\"\n\n\"Never more shall Calmar chase the deer of Morven with Orla,\" said the\nHero. \"What were the chase to me alone? Who would share the spoils of\nbattle with Calmar? Orla is at rest! Rough was thy soul, Orla! yet soft\nto me as the dew of morn. It glared on others in lightning: to me a\nsilver beam of night. Bear my sword to blue-eyed Mora; let it hang in my\nempty hall. It is not pure from blood: but it could not save Orla. Lay\nme with my friend: raise the song when I am dark!\"\n\nThey are laid by the stream of Lubar. Four grey stones mark the dwelling\nof Orla and Calmar. When Swaran was bound, our sails rose on the blue\nwaves. The winds gave our barks to Morven:--the bards raised the song.\n\n\"What Form rises on the roar of clouds? Whose dark Ghost gleams on the\nred streams of tempests? His voice rolls on the thunder. 'Tis Orla, the\nbrown Chief of Oithona. He was unmatched in war. Peace to thy soul,\nOrla! thy fame will not perish. Nor thine, Calmar! Lovely wast thou, son\nof blue-eyed Mora; but not harmless was thy sword. It hangs in thy cave.\nThe Ghosts of Lochlin shriek around its steel. Hear thy praise, Calmar!\nIt dwells on the voice of the mighty. Thy name shakes on the echoes of\nMorven. Then raise thy fair locks, son of Mora. Spread them on the arch\nof the rainbow, and smile through the tears of the storm.","title":"The Death of Calmar and Orla.  an Imitation of MacPherson's \"Ossian\""},{"lines":"  Tu semper amoris\n  Sis memor, et cari comitis ne abscedat imago.\n\n  VAL.

Somerset, British man-of-war;\nA phantom ship, with each mast and spar\nAcross the moon like a prison bar,\nAnd a huge black hulk, that was magnified\nBy its own reflection in the tide.\n\nMeanwhile, his friend through alley and street\nWanders and watches, with eager ears,\nTill in the silence around him he hears\nThe muster of men at the barrack door,\nThe sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,\nAnd the measured tread of the grenadiers,\nMarching down to their boats on the shore.\n\nThen he climbed the tower of the Old North Church,\nBy the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,\nTo the belfry chamber overhead,\nAnd startled the pigeons from their perch\nOn the sombre rafters, that round him made\nMasses and moving shapes of shade,--\nBy the trembling ladder, steep and tall,\nTo the highest window in the wall,\nWhere he paused to listen and look down\nA moment on the roofs of the town\nAnd the moonlight flowing over all.\n\nBeneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,\nIn their night encampment on the hill,\nWrapped in silence so deep and still\nThat he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,\nThe watchful night-wind, as it went\nCreeping along from tent to tent,\nAnd seeming to whisper, \"All is well!\"\nA moment only he feels the spell\nOf the place and the hour, and the secret dread\nOf the lonely belfry and the dead;\nFor suddenly all his thoughts are bent\nOn a shadowy something far away,\nWhere the river widens to meet the bay,--\nA line of black that bends and floats\nOn the rising tide like a bridge of boats.\n\nMeanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,\nBooted and spurred, with a heavy stride\nOn the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.\nNow he patted his horse's side,\nNow he gazed at the landscape far and near,\nThen, impetuous, stamped the earth,\nAnd turned and tightened his saddle girth;\nBut mostly he watched with eager search\nThe belfry tower of the Old North Church,\nAs it rose above the graves on the hill,\nLonely and spectral and sombre and still.\nAnd lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height\nA glimmer, and then a gleam of light!\nHe springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,\nBut lingers and gazes, till full on his sight\nA second lamp in the belfry burns.\n\nA hurry of hoofs in a village street,\nA shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,\nAnd beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark\nStruck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;\nThat was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,\nThe fate of a nation was riding that night;\nAnd the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,\nKindled the land into flame with its heat.\nHe has left the village and mounted the steep,\nAnd beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,\nIs the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;\nAnd under the alders that skirt its edge,\nNow soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,\nIs heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.\n\nIt was twelve by the village clock\nWhen he crossed the bridge into Medford town.\nHe heard the crowing of the cock,\nAnd the barking of the farmer's dog,\nAnd felt the damp of the river fog,\nThat rises after the sun goes down.\n\nIt was one by the village clock,\nWhen he galloped into Lexington.\nHe saw the gilded weathercock\nSwim in the moonlight as he passed,\nAnd the meeting-house windows, black and bare,\nGaze at him with a spectral glare,\nAs if they already stood aghast\nAt the bloody work they would look upon.\n\nIt was two by the village clock,\nWhen he came to the bridge in Concord town.\nHe heard the bleating of the flock,\nAnd the twitter of birds among the trees,\nAnd felt the breath of the morning breeze\nBlowing over the meadow brown.\nAnd one was safe and asleep in his bed\nWho at the bridge would be first to fall,\nWho that day would be lying dead,\nPierced by a British musket ball.\n\nYou know the rest. In the books you have read\nHow the British Regulars fired and fled,---\nHow the farmers gave them ball for ball,\nFrom behind each fence and farmyard wall,\nChasing the redcoats down the lane,\nThen crossing the fields to emerge again\nUnder the trees at the turn of the road,\nAnd only pausing to fire and load.\n\nSo through the night rode Paul Revere;\nAnd so through the night went his cry of alarm\nTo every Middlesex village and farm,---\nA cry of defiance, and not of fear,\nA voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,\nAnd a word that shall echo for evermore!\nFor, borne on the night-wind of the Past,\nThrough all our history, to the last,\nIn the hour of darkness and peril and need,\nThe people will waken and listen to hear\nThe hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,\nAnd the midnight message of Paul Revere.","title":"The Landlord's Tale; Paul Revere's Ride"},{"lines":"When I compare\nWhat I have lost with what I have gained,\nWhat I have missed with what attained,\nLittle room do I find for pride.\n\nI am aware\nHow many days have been idly spent;\nHow like an arrow the good intent\nHas fallen short or been turned aside.\n\nBut who shall dare\nTo measure loss and gain in this wise?\nDefeat may be victory in disguise;\nThe lowest ebb is the turn of the tide.","title":"Loss And Gain"},{"lines":"The night is come, but not too soon;\nAnd sinking silently,\nAll silently, the little moon\nDrops down behind the sky.\n\nThere is no light in earth or heaven\nBut the cold light of stars;\nAnd the first watch of night is given\nTo the red planet Mars.\n\nIs it the tender star of love?\nThe star of love and dreams?\nO no! from that blue tent above,\nA hero's armor gleams.\n\nAnd earnest thoughts within me rise,\nWhen I behold afar,\nSuspended in the evening skies,\nThe shield of that red star.\n\nO star of strength!

the youthful Hiawatha\nSaid within himself and pondered,\nMuch perplexed by various feelings,\nListless, longing, hoping, fearing,\nDreaming still of Minnehaha,\nOf the lovely Laughing Water,\nIn the

woman,\nHands unskilful, feet unwilling;\nBring a wife with nimble fingers,\nHeart and hand that move together,\nFeet that run on willing errands!\"\n\nSmiling answered Hiawatha:\n\"In the land of the

between us,\nThere are feuds yet unforgotten,\nWounds that ache and still may open!\n\nLaughing answered Hiawatha:\n\"For that reason, if no other,\nWould I wed the fair Dacotah,\nThat our tribes might be united,\nThat old feuds might be forgotten,\nAnd old wounds be healed forever!\"\n\nThus departed Hiawatha\nTo the land of the Dacotahs,\nTo the land of handsome women;\nStriding over moor and meadow,\nThrough interminable forests,\nThrough uninterrupted silence.\n\nWith his moccasins of magic,\nAt each stride a mile he measured;\nYet the way seemed long before him,\nAnd his heart outran his footsteps;\nAnd he journeyed without resting,\nTill he heard the cataract's laughter,\nHeard the Falls of Minnehaha\nCalling to him through the silence.\n\"Pleasant is the sound!\" he murmured,\n\"Pleasant is the voice that calls me!\"\n\nOn the outskirts of the forests,\n'Twixt the shadow and the sunshine,\nHerds of fallow deer were feeding,\nBut they saw not Hiawatha;\nTo his bow be whispered, \"Fail not!\"\nTo his arrow whispered, \"Swerve not!\"\nSent it singing on its errand,\nTo the red heart of the roebuck;\nThrew the deer across his shoulder,\nAnd sped forward without pausing.\n\nAt the doorway of his wigwam\nSat his ancient Arrow-maker,\nIn the land of the Dacotahs,\nMaking arrow-heads of jasper,\nArrow-heads of chalcedony.\nAt his side, in all her beauty,\nSat the lovely Minnehaha,\nSat his daughter, Laughing Water,\nPlaiting mats of flags and rushes;\nOf the past the old man's thoughts were,\nAnd the maiden's of the future.\n\nHe was thinking, as he sat there,\nOf the days when with such arrows\nHe had struck the deer and bison,\nOn the Muskoday, the meadow;\nShot the wild goose, flying southward,\nOn the wing, the clamorous Wawa;\nThinking of the great war-parties,\nHow they came to buy his arrows,\nCould not fight without his arrows.\nAh, no more such noble warriors\nCould be found on earth as they were!\nNow the men were all like women,\nOnly used their tongues for weapons!\n\nShe was thinking of a hunter,\nFrom another tribe and country,\nYoung and tall and very handsome,\nWho one morning, in the Spring-time,\nCame to buy her father's arrows,\nLingered long about the doorway,\nSat and rested in the wigwam,\nLooking back as he departed.\nShe had heard her father praise him,\nPraise his courage and his wisdom;\nWould he come again for arrows\nTo the Falls of Minnehaha?\nOn the mat her hands lay idle,\nAnd her eyes were very dreamy.\n\nThrough their thoughts they heard a footstep,\nHeard a rustling in the branches,\nAnd with glowing cheek and forehead,\nWith the deer upon his shoulders,\nSuddenly from out the woodlands\nHiawatha stood before them.\n\nStraight the ancient Arrow-maker\nLooked up gravely from his labor,\nLaid aside the unfinished arrow,\nBade him enter at the doorway,\nSaying, as he rose to meet him,\n\"Hiawatha, you are welcome!\"\n\nAt the feet of Laughing Water\nHiawatha laid his burden,\nThrew the red deer from his shoulders;\nAnd the maiden looked up at him,\nLooked up from her mat of rushes,\nSaid with gentle look and accent,\n\"You are welcome, Hiawatha!\"\n\nVery spacious was the wigwam,\nMade of deer-skins dressed and whitened,\nWith the Gods of the Dacotahs\nDrawn and painted on its curtains,\nAnd so tall the doorway, hardly\nHiawatha stooped to enter,\nHardly touched his eagle-feathers\nAs he entered at the doorway.\n\nThen uprose the Laughing Water,\nFrom the ground fair Minnehaha,\nLaid aside her mat unfinished,\nBrought forth food and set before them,\nWater brought them from the brooklet,\nGave them food in earthen vessels,\nGave them drink in bowls of bass-wood,\nListened while the guest was speaking,\nListened while her father answered,\nBut not once her lips she opened,\nNot a single word she uttered.\n\nYes, as in a dream she listened\nTo the words of Hiawatha,\nAs he talked of old Nokomis,\nWho had nursed him in his childhood,\nAs he told of his companions,\nChibiabos, the musician,\nAnd the very strong man, Kwasind,\nAnd of happiness and plenty\nIn the land of the Ojibways,\nIn the pleasant land and peaceful.\n\n\"After many years of warfare,\nMany years of strife and bloodshed,\nThere is peace between the Ojibways\nAnd the tribe of the Dacotahs.\"\nThus continued Hiawatha,\nAnd then added, speaking slowly,\n'That this peace may last forever,\nAnd our hands be clasped more closely,\nAnd our hearts be more united,\nGive me as my wife this maiden,\nMinnehaha, Laughing Water,\nLoveliest of Dacotah women!\n\nAnd the ancient Arrow-maker\nPaused a moment ere he answered,\nSmoked a little while in silence,\nLooked at Hiawatha proudly,\nFondly looked at Laughing Water,\nAnd made answer very gravely:\n\"Yes, if Minnehaha wishes;\nLet your heart speak, Minnehaha!\"\n\nAnd the lovely Laughing Water\nSeemed more lovely as she stood there,\nNeither willing nor reluctant,\nAs she went to Hiawatha,\nSoftly took the seat beside him,\nWhile she said, and blushed to say it,\n\"I will follow you, my husband!\"\n\nThis was Hiawatha's wooing!\nThus it was he won the daughter\nOf the ancient Arrow-maker,\nIn the land of the Dacotahs!\n\nFrom the wigwam he departed,\nLeading with him Laughing Water;\nHand in hand they went together,\nThrough the woodland and the meadow,\nLeft the old man standing lonely\nAt the doorway of his wigwam,\nHeard the Falls of Minnehaha\nCalling to them from the distance,\nCrying to them from afar off,\n\"Fare thee well, O Minnehaha!\"\n\nAnd the ancient Arrow-maker\nTurned again unto his labor,\nSat down by his sunny doorway,\nMurmuring to himself, and saying:\n\"Thus it is our daughters leave us,\nThose we love, and those who love us!\nJust when they have learned to help us,\nWhen we are old and lean upon them,\nComes a youth with flaunting feathers,\nWith his flute of reeds, a stranger\nWanders piping through the village,\nBeckons to the fairest maiden,\nAnd she follows where he leads her,\nLeaving all things for the stranger!\"\n\nPleasant was the journey homeward,\nThrough interminable forests,\nOver meadow, over mountain,\nOver river, hill, and hollow.\nShort it seemed to Hiawatha,\nThough they journeyed very slowly,\nThough his pace he checked and slackened\nTo the steps of Laughing Water.\n\nOver wide and rushing rivers\nIn his arms he bore the maiden;\nLight he thought her as a feather,\nAs the plume upon his head-gear;\nCleared the tangled pathway for her,\nBent aside the swaying branches,\nMade at night a lodge of branches,\nAnd a bed with boughs of hemlock,\nAnd a fire before the doorway\nWith the dry cones of the pine-tree.\n\nAll the travelling winds went with them,\nO'er the meadows, through the forest;\nAll the stars of night looked at them,\nWatched with sleepless eyes their slumber;\nFrom his ambush in the oak-tree\nPeeped the squirrel, Adjidaumo,\nWatched with eager eyes the lovers;\nAnd the rabbit, the Wabasso,\nScampered from the path before them,\nPeering, peeping from his burrow,\nSat erect upon his haunches,\nWatched with curious eyes the lovers.\n\nPleasant was the journey homeward!\nAll the birds sang loud and sweetly\nSongs of happiness and heart's-ease;\nSang the bluebird, the Owaissa,\n\"Happy are you, Hiawatha,\nHaving such a wife to love you!\"\nSang the robin, the Opechee,\n\"Happy are you, Laughing Water,\nHaving such a noble husband!\"\n\nFrom the sky the sun benignant\nLooked upon them through the branches,\nSaying to them, \"O my children,\nLove is sunshine, hate is shadow,\nLife is checkered shade and sunshine,\nRule by love, O Hiawatha!\"\n\nFrom the sky the moon looked at them,\nFilled the lodge with mystic splendors,\nWhispered to them, \"O my children,\nDay is restless, night is quiet,\nMan imperious, woman feeble;\nHalf is mine, although I follow;\nRule by patience, Laughing Water!\"\n\nThus it was they journeyed homeward;\nThus it was that Hiawatha\nTo the lodge of old Nokomis\nBrought the moonlight, starlight, firelight,\nBrought the sunshine of his people,\nMinnehaha, Laughing Water,\nHandsomest of all the women\nIn the land of

but now once more\nGrav'd on the living tablet of the heart,\nAnd deep impress'd by energy divine,\nIs legible through an eternal age.\n\n\nNorth of Judea now this day appears\nOn Syria west, and in each city fair\nFull many a church of noble fame doth rise.\nIn Antioch the seat of Syrian kings,\nAnd old Damascus, where Hazael reign'd.\nNow Cappadocia Mithridates' realm,\nAnd poison-bearing Pontus, whose deep shades\nWere shades of death, admit the light of truth.\nIn Asia less seven luminaries rise,\nBright lights, which with celestial vigour burn,\nAnd give the day in fullest glory round.\nThere Symrna shines, and Thyatira there,\nThere Ephesus a sister light appears,\nAnd Pergamus with kindred glory burns:\nShe burns enkindled with a purer flame\nThan Troy of old, when Grecian kings combin'd\nHad set her gates on fire: The Hellespont\nAnd all th' Egean sea shone to the blaze.\n\n\nBut now more west the gracious day serene\nOn Athens rising, throws a dark eclipse\nOn that high learning by her sages taught,\nIn each high school of philosophic fame;\nVain wisdom, useless sophistry condemn'd,\nAs ignorance and foolishness of men.\nLet her philosophers debate no more\nIn the Lyceum, or the Stoics porch,\nHolding high converse, but in error lost\nOf pain, and happiness, and fate supreme.\nFair truth from heav'n draws all their reas'ning high\nIn captive chains bound at her chariot wheels.\n\n\nNow Rome imperial, mistress of the world\nDrinks the pure lustre of the orient ray\nAssuaging her fierce thirst of bloody war,\nDominion boundless, victory and fame;\nEach bold centurion, and each prætor finds\nA nobler empire to subdue themselves.\n\n\nFrom Rome the mistress of the world in peace,\nFar to the north the golden light ascends;\nTo Gaul and Britain and the utmost bound\nOf Thule famous in poetic song,\nVictorious there where not Rome's consuls brave,\nHeroes, or conquering armies, ever came.\nFar in the artic skies a light is seen,\nUnlike that sun, which shall ere long retreat,\nAnd leave their hills one half the year in shades.\nOr that Aurora which the sailor sees\nBeneath the pole in dancing beams of light,\nPlaying its gambols on the northern hills.\nThat light is vain and gives no genial heat,\nTo warm the tenants of those frozen climes,\nOr give that heav'nly vigour to the soul,\nWhich truth divine and revelation brings;\nAnd but for which each heart must still remain,\nHard as the rock on Scandanavia's shore,\nCold as the ice which bridges up her streams,\nFierce as the storm which tempests all her waves.\n\n\nThus in its dawn did sacred truth prevail,\nIn either hemisphere from north to south,\nFrom east to west through the long tract of day.\nFrom Shinar's plain to Thule's utmost isle,\nFrom Persia's bay to Scandanavia's shores.\nCheer'd by its ray now ev'ry valley smiles,\nAnd ev'ry lawn smote by its morning beam.\nNow ev'ry hill reflects a purer ray,\nThan when Aurora paints his woods in gold,\nOr when the sun first in the orient sky,\nSets thick with gems the dewy mountain's brow.\n\n\nThe earth perceives a sov'reign virtue shed\nAnd from each cave, and midnight haunt retires\nDark superstition, with her vot'ries skill'd,\nIn potent charm, or spell of magic pow'r;\nIn augury, by voice, or flight of birds,\nOr boding sign at morn, or noon, or eve,\nPortent and prodigy and omen dire.\nEach oracle by Demon, or the craft\nOf priests, made vocal, can declare no more\nOf high renown, and victory secure,\nTo kings low prostrate at their bloody shrines.\nNo more with vain uncertainty perplex\nMistaken worshippers, or give unseen\nResponse ambiguous in some mystic sound,\nAnd hollow murmer from the dark recess.\nNo more of Lybian Jove; Dodona's oaks,\nIn sacred grove give prophecy no more.\nTh' infernal deities retire abash'd,\nOur God himself on earth begins his reign;\nPure revelation beams on ev'ry land,\nOn ev'ry heart exerts a sov'reign sway,\nAnd makes the human nature grow divine.\n\n\nNow hideous war forgets one half her rage,\nAnd smoothes her visage horible to view.\nCelestial graces better sooth the soul,\nThan vocal music, or the charming sound\nOf harp or lyre. More than the golden lyre\nWhich Orpheus tun'd in melancholy notes,\nWhich almost pierc'd the dull cold ear of death,\nAnd mov'd the grave to give him back his bride.\n\n\nPeace with the graces and fair science now\nWait on the gospel car; science improv'd\nPuts on a fairer dress; a fairer form\nNow ev'ry art assumes; bold eloquence\nMoves in a higher sphere than senates grave,\nOr mix'd assembly, or the hall of kings,\nWhich erst with pompous panegyric rung.\nVain words and soothing flattery she hates,\nAnd feigned tears, and tongue which silver-tipt\nMoves in the cause of wickedness and pride.\nShe mourns not that fair liberty depress'd\nWhich kings tyrannic can extort, but that\nPure freedom of the soul to truth divine\nWhich first indulg'd her and with envious hand\nPluck'd thence, left hideous slavery behind.\nShe weeps not loss of property on earth,\nNor stirs the multitude to dire revenge\nWith headlong violence, but soothes the soul\nTo harmony and peace, bids them aspire\nWith emulation and pure zeal of heart,\nTo that high glory in the world unseen,\nAnd crown celestial, which pure virtue gives.\n\n\nThus eloquence and poesy divine\nA nobler range of sentiment receive;\nLife brought to view and immortality,\nA recent world through which bold fancy roves,\nAnd gives new magic to the pow'r of song;\nFor where the streams of revelation flow\nUnknown to bards of Helicon, or those\nWho on the top of Pindus, or the banks\nOf Arethusa and Eurotas stray'd,\nThe poet drinks, and glorying in new strength,\nSoars high in rapture of sublimer strains;\nSuch as that prophet sang who tun'd his harp\nOn Zion hill and with seraphic praise\nIn psalm and sacred ode by Siloa's brook,\nDrew HIS attention who first touch'd the soul\nWith taste of harmony, and bade the spheres\nMove in rich measure to the songs on high.\nFill'd with this spirit poesy no more\nAdorns that vain mythology believ'd,\nBy rude barbarian, and no more receives,\nThe tale traditional, and hymn profane,\nSung by high genius, basely prostitute.\nNew strains are heard, such as first in the morn\nOf time, were sung by the angelic choirs,\nWhen rising from chaotic state the earth\nOrbicular was seen, and over head\nThe blazing sun, moon, planet, and each light\nThat gilds the firmament, rush'd into view.\n\n\nThus did the sun of revelation shine\nFull on the earth, and grateful were its beams:\nIts beams were grateful to the chosen seed,\nTo all whose works were worthy of the day.\nBut creatures lucifuge, whose ways were dark,\nEre this in shades of paganism hid,\nDid vent their poison, and malignant breath,\nTo stain the splendour of the light divine,\nWhich pierc'd their cells and brought their deeds to view\nNum'rous combin'd of ev'ry tongue and tribe,\nMade battle proud, and impious war brought on,\nAgainst the chosen sanctified by light.\nRiches and pow'r leagu'd in their train were seen,\nSword, famine, flames and death before them prey'd.\nThose faithful found, who undismay'd did bear\nA noble evidence to truth, were slain.\nWhy should I sing of these or here record,\nAs if 'twere praise, in poesy or song,\nOr sculptur'd stone, to eternize the names,\nWhich writ elsewhere in the fair book of life,\nShall live unsullied when each strain shall die:\nShall undefac'd remain when sculptur'd stone,\nAnd monument, and bust, and storied urn\nPerpetuates its sage and king no more.\n\n\nThe pow'r of torture and reproach was vain,\nBut what not torture or reproach could do,\nDark superstition did in part effect.\nThat superstition, which saint John beheld,\nRise in thick darkness from th' infernal lake.\nLocust and scorpion in the smoke ascend,\nFalse teacher, heretic, and Antichrist.\nThe noon day sun is dark'ned in the sky,\nThe moon forbears to give her wonted light.\nFull many a century the darkness rul'd,\nWith heavier gloom than once on Egypt came,\nSave that on some lone coast, or desert isle,\nWhere sep'rate far a chosen spirit dwelt,\nA Goshen shone, with partial-streaming ray.\nNight on the one side settles dark; on Rome,\nIt settles dark, and ev'ry land more west\nIs wrapt in shades. Night on the east comes down\nWith gloom Tartarean, and in part it rose\nFrom Tartary beneath the dusky pole.\nThe ruthless Turk, and Saracen in arms,\nO'er-run the land the gospel once illum'd;\nThe holy land Judea once so nam'd,\nAnd Syria west where many churches rose.\nThose golden luminaries are remov'd,\nWhich once in Asia shone. Athens no more\nFor truth and learning fam'd. Corinth obscur'd,\nIonia mourns through all her sea-girt isles.\n\n\nBut yet once more the light of truth shall shine\nIn this obscure sojourn; shall shoot its beam\nIn morning beauty mild, o'er hill and dale.\nSee in Bohemia and the lands more west\nThe heavenly ray of revelation shines,\nFresh kindling up true love and purest zeal.\n\n\nBritannia next beholds the risen day\nIn reformation bright; cheerful she hails\nIt from her snow-white cliffs, and bids her sons,\nRise from the mist of popery obscure.\nHer worthier sons, whom not Rome's pontiff high,\nNor king with arbitrary sway could move.\nThose mightier who with constancy untam'd,\nDid quench the violence of fire, at death\nDid smile, and maugre ev'ry pain, of bond,\nCold dark imprisonment, and scourge severe,\nBy hell-born popery devis'd, held fast\nThe Christian hope firm anchor of the soul.\nOr those who shunning that fell rage of war,\nAnd persecution dire, when civil pow'r,\nLeagu'd in with sacerdotal sway triumph'd,\nO'er ev'ry conscience, and the lives of men,\nDid brave th' Atlantic deep and through its storms\nSought these Americ shores: these happier shores\nWhere birds of calm delight to play, where not\nRome's pontiff high, nor arbitrary king,\nLeagu'd in with sacerdotal sway are known.\nBut peace and freedom link'd together dwell,\nAnd reformation in full glory shines.\nOh for a muse of more exalted wing,\nTo celebrate those men who planted first\nThe christian church in these remotest lands;\nFrom those high plains where spreads a colony,\nGen'rous and free, from Massachusett-shores,\nTo the cold lakes margin'd with snow: from that\nLong dreary tract of shady woods and hills,\nWhere Hudson's icy stream rolls his cold wave,\nTo those more sunny bowers where zephyrs breath,\nAnd round which flow in circling current swift\nThe Delaware and Susquehannah streams.\nThence to those smiling plains where Chesapeak\nSpreads her maternal arms, encompassing\nIn soft embrace, full many a settlement,\nWhere opulence, with hospitality,\nAnd polish'd manners, and the living plant\nOf science blooming, sets their glory high [1].\nThence to Virginia, sister colony,\nLib'ral in sentiment, and breathing high,\nThe noble ardour of the freeborn soul.\nTo Carolina thence, and that warm clime\nWhere Georgia south in summer heat complains,\nAnd distant thence towards the burning line.\n\n\nThese men deserve our song, and those who still,\nWith industry severe, and steady aim\nDiffuse the light in this late dreary land,\nIn whose lone wastes and solitudes forlorn,\nDeath long sat brooding with his raven wing.\nWho many 'a structure of great fame have rais'd,\nCollege, and school, upon th' Atlantic coast,\nOr inland town, through ev'ry province wide,\nWhich rising up like pyramids of fire,\nGive light and glory to the western world.\n\n\nThese men we honour, and their names shall last\nSweet in the mouths and memory of men;\nOr if vain man unconscious of their worth,\nRefuse a tear when in some lonely vale\nHe sees those faithful laid; each breeze shall sigh,\nEach passing gale shall mourn, each tree shall bend\nIts heavy head, in sorrow o'er their tombs,\nAnd some sad stream run ever weeping by.\nWeep not O stream, nor mourn thou passing gale,\nBeneath those grassy tombs their bodies lie,\nBut they have risen from each labour bere\nTo make their entrance on a nobler stage.\nWhat though with us they walk the humble vale\nOf indigence severe, with want oppress'd?\nRiches belong not to their family,\nNor sloth luxurious nor the pride of kings;\nBut truth meek-ey'd and warm benevolence\nWisdom's high breeding in her sons rever'd\nBespeaks them each the children[2] of a king.\nThe christian truth of origin divine,\nGrows not beneath the shade of civil pow'r,\nRiches or wealth accompanied with pride;\nNor shall it bloom transplanted to that soil,\nWhere persecution, in malignant streams,\nFlows out to water it; black streams and foul\nWhich from the lake of Tartarus break forth,\nThe sickly tide of Acheron which flows,\nWith putrid waves through the infernal shades.\nThis plant of heaven loves the gentle beams,\nOf truth and meekness, and the kindly dew\nWhich fell on Zion hill; it loves the care\nOf humble shepherds, and the rural swain,\nAnd tended by their hands it flourishes\nWith fruit and blossoms, and soon gives a shade,\nBeneath which ev'ry traveller shall rest,\nSafe from the burning east-wind and the sun.\nA vernal shade not with'ring like the gourd\nOf him who warned Nineveh, but like\nThe aged oaks immortal on the plain\nOf Kadesh, or tall cedars on the hill\nOf Lebanon, and Hermon's shady top.\n\n\nHigh is their fame through each succeeding age\nWho build the walls of Zion upon earth.\nLet mighty kings and potentates combine,\nTo raise a pyramid, which neither storm,\nNor sea indignant, nor the raging fire,\nNor time can waste, or from firm basis move.\nOr let them strive by counsel or by arms,\nTo fix a throne, and in imperial sway,\nBuild up a kingdom shadowing the earth,\nUnmov'd by thunder or impetuous storm\nOf civil war, dark treason, or the shock\nOf hostile nations, in dire league combin'd.\nThey build a kingdom of a nobler date,\nWho build the kingdom of the Saviour God.\nThis, not descending rain, nor mighty storm,\nNor sea indignant, nor the raging fire,\nNor time shall waste, or from firm basis move.\nRounded on earth its head doth reach the skies,\nSecure from thunder, and impetuous storm,\nOf civil war, dark treason, or the shock\nOf hostile nations in dire league combin'd.\nThis still shall flourish and survive the date,\nOf each wide state and empire of the earth\nWhich yet shall rise, as now of those which once\nFrom richest Asia or from Europe spread\nOn mighty base and shaded half the world.\nGreat Babylon which vex'd the chosen seed,\nAnd by whose streams the captive Hebrews sat,\nIn desolation lies, and Syria west,\nWhere the Seleucidæ did fix their throne,\nLoud-thund'ring thence o'er Judah's spoiled land,\nBoasts her proud rule no more. Rome pagan next,\nThe raging furnace where the saints were tried,\nNo more enslaves mankind. Rome papal too\nContracts her reign and speaks proud things no more.\nThe throne of Ottoman is made to shake,\nThe Russian thund'ring to his firmest seat;\nAnother age shall see his empire fall.\nYet in the east the light of truth shall shine,\nAnd like the sun returning after storms\nWhich long had raged through a sunless sky,\nShall beam beningly on forsaken lands.\nThe day serene once more on Zion hill\nDescending gradual, shall in radiance beam\nOn Canaan's happy land. Her fav'rite seers\nHave intercourse divine with this pure source;\nPerennial thence rich streams of light shall flow,\nTo each adjoining vale and desert plain\nLost in the umbrage of dark heathen shades.\nThe gospel light shall gloriously survive\nThe wasting blaze of ev'ry baser fire.\nThe fire of Vesta, an eternal fire,\nSo falsely call'd and kept alive at Rome;\nSepulchral lamp in burial place of kings,\nBurn'd unconsum'd for many ages down;\nBut yet not Vesta's fire eternal call'd\nAnd kept alive at Rome, nor burning lamp\nHid in sepulchral monument of kings,\nShall bear an equal date with that true light,\nWhich shone from earth to heav'n, and which shall shine\nUp through eternity, and be the light\nOf heav'n, the new Jerusalem above.\nThis light from heav'n shall yet illume the earth\nAnd give its beams to each benighted land\nNow with new glory lighted up again.\nThen ruthless Turk and Saracen shall know\nThe fallacies of him Medina bred,\nAnd whose vain tomb, in Mecca they adore.\nThen Jews shall view the great Messiah come,\nAnd each rent tribe in caravan by land,\nOr ship by sea, shall visit Palestine\nThrice holy then, with vile Idolatry\nNo more defil'd, altar on mountain head,\nGreen shady hill, or idol of the grove.\nFor there a light appears, with which compar'd,\nThat was a twilight shed by rite obscure,\nAnd ceremony dark and sacrifice\nDimly significant of things to come.\nBlest with this light no more they deviate\nIn out-way path; distinguished no more\nBy school or sect, Essene or Saducee,\nCairite or Scribe of Pharisaic mould.\nJew and Samaritan debate no more,\nWhether on Gerizim or Zion hill\nThey shall bow down. Above Moriah's mount\nEach eye is raised to him, whose temple is\nTh' infinitude of space, whom earth, sea, sky\nAnd heav'n itself cannot contain. No more\nThe noise of battle shall be heard, or shout\nOf war by heathen princes wag'd; There's nought\nShall injure or destroy; they shall not hurt\nIn all my holy mountain saith the Lord.\nThe earth in peace and ev'ry shadow fled,\nBespeaks Emmanuel's happy reign when Jew,\nAnd kindred Gentile shall no more contend,\nSave in the holier strife of hymn and song,\nTo him who leads captive captivity,\nWho shall collect the sons of Jacob's line,\nAnd bring the fulness of the Gentiles in.\nThrice happy day when Gentiles are brought in\nComplete and full; when with its genial beams\nThe day shall break on each benighted land\nWhich yet in darkness and in vision lies:\nOn Scythia and Tartary's bleak hills;\nOn mount Imaus, and Hyrcanian cliffs\nOf Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales;\nJapan and China, and the sea-girt isles\nThe ancient Ophir deem'd; for there rich gems\nAnd diamond pearl, and purest gold is found.\n\n\nThrice happy day when this whole earth shall feel\nThe sacred ray of revelation shed,\nFar to the west, through each remotest land\nWith equal glory rivalling the day\nPour'd on the east. When these Americ shores\nShall far and wide be light, and heav'nly day\nShall in full glory rise on many a reign,\nKingdom and empire bending to the south,\nAnd nation touching the Pacific shore.\nWhen Christian churches shall adorn the streams\nWhich now unheeded flow with current swift\nCircling the hills, where fiercest beasts of prey,\nPanther and wolf in nightly concert howl.\nThe Indian sage from superstition freed,\nBe taught a nobler heav'n than cloud-topt-hill,\nOr sep'rate island in the wat'ry waste.\nThe aged Sachem fix his moving tribe,\nAnd grow humane now taught the arts of peace.\nIn human sacrifice delight no more,\nMad cantico or savage feast of war.\nSuch scenes of fierce barbarity no more\nBe perpetrated there, but truth divine\nShine on the earth in one long cloudless day,\nTill that last hour which shuts the scene of things,\nWhen this pure light shall claim its native skies;\nWhen the pure stream of revelation shall,\nWith refluent current visit its first hills:\nThere shall it mix with that crystalline wave,\nWhich laves the walls of Paradise on high,\nAnd from beneath the seat of God doth spring.\nThis is that river from whose sacred head\nThe sanctified in golden arms draw light,\nOn either side of which that tree doth grow\nWhich yields immortal fruit, and in whose shade\nIf shade were needed there, the rapt shall sing,\nIn varied melody to harp and lyre,\nThe sacred song of Moses and the Lamb:\nEternity's high arches ring; 'Tis heard\nThrough both infinitudes of space and time.\n\n\nThus have I sung to this high-favour'd bow'r,\nAnd sacred shades which taught me first to sing,\nWith grateful mind a tributary strain.\nSweet grove no more I visit you, no more\nBeneath your shades shall meditate my lay.\nAdieu ye lawns and thou fair hill adieu,\nAnd you O shepherds, and ye graces fair\nWith comely presence honouring the day,\nFar hence I go to some sequest'red vale\nBy woody hill or shady mountain side,\nWhere far from converse and the social band,\nMy days shall pass inglorious away: [3]\nBut this shall be my exultation still\nMy chiefest merit and my only joy,\nThat when the hunter on some western hill,\nOr furzy glade shall see my grassy tomb,\nAnd know the stream which mourns unheeded by,\nHe for a moment shall repress his step,\nAnd say, There lies a Son of Nassau-Hall.","title":"A poem on divine revelation"},{"lines":"LEANDER.\nNo more of Memphis and her mighty kings,\nOr Alexandria, where the Ptolomies.\nTaught golden commerce to unfurl her falls,\nAnd bid fair science smile: No more of Greece\nWhere learning next her early visit paid,\nAnd spread her glories to illume the world,\nNo more of Athens, where she flourished,\nAnd saw her sons of mighty genius rise\nSmooth flowing Plato, Socrates and him\nWho with resistless eloquence reviv'd\nThe Spir't of Liberty, and shook the thrones\nOf Macedon and Persia's haughty king.\nNo more of Rome enlighten'd by her beams,\nFresh kindling there the fire of eloquence,\nAnd poesy divine; imperial Rome!\nWhose wide dominion reach'd o'er half the globe;\nWhose eagle flew o'er Ganges to the East,\nAnd in the West far to the British isles.\nNo more of Britain, and her kings renown'd,\nEdward's and Henry's thunderbolts of war;\nHer chiefs victorious o'er the Gallic foe;\nIllustrious senators, immortal bards,\nAnd wise philosophers, of these no more.\nA Theme more new, tho' not less noble claims\nOur ev'ry thought on this auspicious day\nThe rising glory of this western world,\nWhere now the dawning light of science spreads\nHer orient ray, and wakes the muse's song;\nWhere freedom holds her sacred standard high,\nAnd commerce rolls her golden tides profuse\nOf elegance and ev'ry joy of life.\n\n\n\nACASTO.\nSince then Leander you attempt a strain\nSo new, so noble and so full of fame;\nAnd since a friendly concourse centers here\nAmerica's own sons, begin O muse!\nNow thro' the veil of ancient days review\nThe period fam'd when first Columbus touch'd\nThe shore so long unknown, thro' various toils,\nFamine and death, the hero made his way,\nThro' oceans bestowing with eternal storms.\nBut why, thus hap'ly found, should we resume\nThe tale of Cortez, furious chief, ordain'd\nWith Indian blood to dye the sands, and choak\nFam'd Amazonia's stream with dead!

welcome up from his sick bed\nYour uncle Gamelyn.\"\n\nAnd Robin leaped, and thought so too;\nAnd so he has grasped her gown,\nAnd now looking back, they have lost the view\nOf merry sweet Locksley

into a curl somehow\nBeside his merrier cheek.\n\nGreat love to him his uncle too\nThe noble Gamelyn bare,\nAnd often said, as his mother knew,\nThat he should be his heir.\n\nGamelyn's eyes, now getting dim,\nWould twinkle at his sight,\nAnd his ruddy wrinkles laugh at him\nBetween his locks so white:\n\nFor Robin already let him see\nHe should beat his playmates all\nAt wrestling, running,

out a fat friar.\n\n\"How now,\" said the fat friar angrily,\n\"What is this knocking so wild?\"\nBut when he saw young Robin's eye,\nHe said \"Go round, my child.\n\n\"Go round to the hall, and I'll tell you all.\"\n\"He'll tell us all!\" thought Robin;\nAnd his mother and he went quietly,\nThough her heart was set a throbbing.\n\nThe friar stood in the inner door,\nAnd tenderly said, \"I

sought her west,\nHe sought through park and plain;\nHe sought her where she might have been\nBut found her not again.\nI cannot curse thee, mother,\nThough thine's the blame, said he\nI cannot curse thee, mother,\nThough thou'st done worse to me.\nYet do I curse thy pride that aye\nSo tauntingly aspires;\nFor my love was a gay knight's heir,\nAnd my father was a squire's.\n\nAnd I will sell my park and hall;\nAnd if ye wed again\nYe shall not wed for titles twice\nThat made ye once so vain.\nSo if ye will wed, wed for love,\nAs I was fain to do;\nYe've gave to me a broken heart,\nAnd I'll give nought to you.\n\nYour pride has wronged your own heart's blood;\nFor she was mine by grace,\nAnd now my lady love is gone\nNone else shall take her place.\nI'll sell my park and sell my hall\nAnd sink my titles too.\nYour pride's done wrong enough as now\nTo leave it more to do.\n\nShe owneth none that owned them all\nAnd would have graced them well;\nNone else shall take the right she missed\nNor in my bosom dwell.--\nAnd then he took and burnt his will\nBefore his mother's face,\nAnd tore his patents all in two,\nWhile tears fell down apace--\nBut in his mother's haughty look\nYe nought but frowns might trace.\n\nAnd then he sat him down to grieve,\nBut could not sit for pain.\nAnd then he laid him on the bed\nAnd ne'er got up again.","title":"The Maid Of Ocram or,

dislike and after to dispise;\nThen, Cyclop-like, in human flesh to deal,\nChop up a minister at every meal;\nPerhaps not wholly to melt down the king,\nBut clip his regal rights within the ring;\nFrom thence to asssume the power of peace and war\nAnd ease him by degrees of public care.\nYet, to consult his dignity and fame,\nHe should have leave to exercise the name,\nAnd hold the cards while Commons played the game.\nFor what can power give more than food and drink,\nTo live at ease and not be bound to think?\nThese are the cooler methods of their crime,\nBut their hot zealots think 'tis loss of time;\nOn utmost bounds of loyalty they stand,\nAnd grin and whet like a Croatian band\nThat waits impatient for the last command:\nThus outlaws open villainy maintain;\nThey steal not, but in squadrons scour the plain;\nAnd if their power the passengers subdue,\nThe most most have right, the wrong is in the few.\nSuch impious axioms foolishly they show,\nFor in some soils Republics

canting friends thy mortal foes would be,\nThy god and theirs will never long agree;\nFor thine, if thou hast any, must be one\nThat lets the world and human kind alone;\nA jolly god that passes hours too well\nTo promise Heaven or threaten us with Hell,\nThat unconcerned can at rebellion sit\nAnd wink at crimes he did himself commit.\nA tyrant theirs; the heaven their priesthood paints\nA conventicle of gloomy sullen saints;\nA heaven, like Bedlam, slovenly and sad,\nForedoomed for souls with false religion mad.\n\nWithout a vision poets can foreshow\nWhat all but fools by common sense may know:\nIf true succession from our Isle should fail,\nAnd crowds profane with impious arms prevail,\nNot thou nor those thy factious arts engage\nShall reap that harvest of rebellious rage,\nWith which thou flatterest thy decrepit age.\nThe swelling poison of the several sects,\nWhich, wanting vent, the nation's health infects,\nShall burst its bag; and fighting out their way,\nThe various venoms on each other prey.\nThe Presbyter, puffed up with spiritual pride,\nShall on the necks of the lewd nobles ride,\nHis brethren damn, the civil power defy,\nAnd parcel out republic prelacy.\nBut short shall be his reign; his rigid yoke\nAnd tyrant power will puny sects provoke,\nAnd frogs, and toads, and all the tadpole train\nWill croak to Heaven for help from this devouring crane.\nThe cut-throat sword and clamorous gown shall jar\nIn sharing their ill-gotten spoils of war;\nChiefs shall be grudged the part which they pretend;\nLords envy lords, and friends with every friend\nAbout their impious merit shall contend.\nThe surly Commons shall respect deny\nAnd justle peerage out with property.\nTheir General either shall his trust betray\nAnd force the crowd to arbitrary sway,\nOr they, suspecting his ambitious aim,\nIn hate of kings shall cast anew the frame\nAnd thrust out Collatine that bore their name.\n\nThus inborn broils the factions would engage,\nOr wars of exiled

Household It Describes\n\nThis Poem is Dedicated by the Author\n\n\"As the Spirit of Darkness be stronger in the dark, so Good Spirits, which be Angels of Light, are augmented not only by the Divine light of the Sun, but also by our common Wood Fire: and as the Celestial Fire drives away dark spirits, so also this our fire of Wood doth the same.\"\nCor. Agrippa, Occult Philosophy, Book I, ch. v.\n\n\n\"Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,\nArrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,\nSeems nowhere to alight: the whited air\nHides hills and woods, the river and the heaven,\nAnd veils the farm-house at the garden's end.\nThe sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet\nDelayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit\nAround the radiant fireplace, enclosed\nIn a tumultuous privacy of Storm.\"\nEmerson,The Snow Storm.\n\n\nThe sun that brief December day\nRose cheerless over hills of gray,\nAnd, darkly circled, gave at noon\nA sadder light than waning moon.\nSlow tracing down the thickening sky\nIts mute and ominous prophecy,\nA portent seeming less than threat,\nIt sank from sight before it set.\nA chill no coat, however stout,\nOf homespun stuff could quite shut out,\nA hard, dull bitterness of cold,\nThat checked, mid-vein, the circling race\nOf life-blood in the sharpened face,\nThe coming of the snow-storm told.\nThe wind blew east; we heard the roar\nOf Ocean on his wintry shore,\nAnd felt the strong pulse throbbing there\nBeat with low rhythm our inland air.\nMeanwhile we did our nightly chores,\nBrought in the wood from out the doors,\nLittered the stalls, and from the mows\nRaked down the herd's-grass for the cows;\nHeard the horse whinnying for his corn;\nAnd, sharply clashing horn on horn,\nImpatient down the stanchion rows\nThe cattle shake their walnut bows;\nWhile, peering from his early perch\nUpon the scaffold's pole of birch,\nThe cock his crested helmet bent\nAnd down his querulous challenge sent.\n\nUnwarmed by any sunset light\nThe gray day darkened into night,\nA night made hoary with the swarm\nAnd whirl-dance of the blinding storm,\nAs zigzag, wavering to and fro,\nCrossed and recrossed the wingëd snow:\nAnd ere the early bedtime came\nThe white drift piled the window-frame,\nAnd through the glass the clothes-line posts\nLooked in like tall and sheeted ghosts.\nThe old familiar sights of ours\nTook marvellous shapes; strange domes and towers\nRose up where sty or corn-crib stood,\nOr garden-wall, or belt of wood;\nA smooth white mound the brush-pile showed,\nA fenceless drift what once was road;\nThe bridle-post an old man sat\nWith loose-flung coat and high cocked hat;\nThe well-curb had a Chinese roof;\nAnd even the long sweep, high aloof,\nIn its slant spendor, seemed to tell\nOf Pisa's leaning miracle.\n\nA prompt, decisive man, no breath\nOur father wasted: \"Boys, a path!\"\nWell pleased (for when did farmer boy\nCount such a summons less than joy?)\nOur buskins on our feet we drew;\nWith mittened hands, and caps drawn low,\nTo guard our necks and ears from snow,\nWe cut the solid whiteness through.\nAnd, where the drift was deepest, made\nA tunnel walled and overlaid\nWith dazzling crystal: we had read\nOf rare Aladdin's wondrous cave,\nAnd to our own his name we gave,\nWith many a wish the luck were ours\nTo test his lamp's supernal powers.\nWe reached the barn with merry din,\nAnd roused the prisoned brutes within.\nThe old horse thrust his long head out,\nAnd grave with wonder gazed about;\nThe cock his lusty greeting said,\nAnd forth his speckled harem led;\nThe oxen lashed their tails, and hooked,\nAnd mild reproach of hunger looked;\nThe hornëd patriarch of the sheep,\nLike Egypt's Amun roused from sleep,\nShook his sage head with gesture mute,\nAnd emphasized with stamp of foot.\n\nAll day the gusty north-wind bore\nThe loosening drift its breath before;\nLow circling round its southern zone,\nThe sun through dazzling snow-mist shone.\nNo church-bell lent its Christian tone\nTo the savage air, no social smoke\nCurled over woods of snow-hung oak.\nA solitude made more intense\nBy dreary-voicëd elements,\nThe shrieking of the mindless wind,\nThe moaning tree-boughs swaying blind,\nAnd on the glass the unmeaning beat\nOf ghostly finger-tips of sleet.\nBeyond the circle of our hearth\nNo welcome sound of toil or mirth\nUnbound the spell, and testified\nOf human life and thought outside.\nWe minded that the sharpest ear\nThe buried brooklet could not hear,\nThe music of whose liquid lip\nHad been to us companionship,\nAnd, in our lonely life, had grown\nTo have an almost human tone.\n\nAs night drew on, and, from the crest\nOf wooded knolls that ridged the west,\nThe sun, a snow-blown traveller, sank\nFrom sight beneath the smothering bank,\nWe piled, with care, our nightly stack\nOf wood against the chimney-back, --\nThe oaken log, green, huge, and thick,\nAnd on its top the stout back-stick;\nThe knotty forestick laid apart,\nAnd filled between with curious art\nThe ragged brush; then, hovering near,\nWe watched the first red blaze appear,\nHeard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam\nOn whitewashed wall and sagging beam,\nUntil the old, rude-furnished room\nBurst, flower-like, into rosy bloom;\nWhile radiant with a mimic flame\nOutside the sparkling drift became,\nAnd through the bare-boughed lilac-tree\nOur own warm hearth seemed blazing free.\nThe crane and pendent trammels showed,\nThe Turks' heads on the andirons glowed;\nWhile childish fancy, prompt to tell\nThe meaning of the miracle,\nWhispered the old rhyme: \"Under the tree,\nWhen fire outdoors burns merrily,\nThere the witches are making tea.\"\nThe moon above the eastern wood\nShone at its full; the hill-range stood\nTransfigured in the silver flood,\nIts blown snows flashing cold and keen,\nDead white, save where some sharp ravine\nTook shadow, or the sombre green\nOf hemlocks turned to pitchy black\nAgainst the whiteness at their back.\nFor such a world and such a night\nMost fitting that unwarming light,\nWhich only seemd where'er it fell\nTo make the coldness visible.\n\nShut in from all the world without,\nWe sat the clean-winged hearth about,\nContent to let the north-wind roar\nIn baffled rage at pane and door,\nWhile the red logs before us beat\nThe frost-line back with tropic heat;\nAnd ever, when a louder blast\nShook beam and rafter as it passed,\nThe merrier up its roaring draught\nThe great throat of the chimney laughed;\nThe house-dog on his paws outspread\nLaid to the fire his drowsy head,\nThe cat's dark silhouette on the wall\nA couchant tiger's seemed to fall;\nAnd, for the winter fireside meet,\nBetween the andirons' straddling feet,\nThe mug of cider simmered slow,\nThe apples sputtered in a row,\nAnd, close at hand, the basket stood\nWith nuts from brown October's wood.\n\nWhat matter how the night behaved?\nWhat matter how the north-wind raved?\nBlow high, blow low, not all its snow\nCould quench our hearth-fire's ruddy glow.\nO Time and Change! -- with hair as gray\nAs was my sire's that winter day,\nHow strange it seems with so much gone,\nOf life and love, to still live on!\nAh, brother! only I and thou\nAre left of all that circle now, --\nThe dear home faces whereupon\nThat fitful firelight paled and shone.\nHenceforward, listen as we will,\nThe voices of that hearth are still;\nLook where we may, the wide earth o'er,\nThose lighted faces smile no more.\nWe tread the paths their feet have worn,\nWe sit beneath their orchard trees,\nWe hear, like them, the hum of bees\nAnd rustle of the bladed corn;\nWe turn the pages that they read,\nTheir written words we linger o'er.\nBut in the sun they cast no shade,\nNo voice is heard, no sign is made,\nNo step is on the conscious floor!\nYet love will dream, and Faith will trust\n(Since He who knows our need is just),\nThat somehow, somewhere, meet we must.\nAlas for him who never sees\nThe stars shine through his cypress-trees!\nWho, hopeless, lays his dead away,\nNor looks to see the breaking day\nAcross the mourful marbles play!\nWho hath not learned, in hours of faith,\nThe truth to flesh and sense unknown,\nThat Life is ever lord of Death,\nAnd Love can never lose its own!\n\nWe sped the time with stories old,\nWrought puzzles out, and riddles told,\nOr stammered from our school-book lore\n\"The Chief of Gambia's golden shore.\"\nHow often since, when all the land\nWas clay in Slavery's shaping hand,\nAs if a far-blown trumpet stirred\nThe languorous sin-sick air, I heard:\n\"Does not the voice of reason cry,\nClaim the first right which Nature gave,\nFrom the red scourge of bondage to fly,\nNor deign to live a burdened slave!\"\nOur father rode again his ride\nOn Memphremagog's wooded side;\nSat down again to moose and samp\nIn trapper's hut and Indian camp;\nLived o'er the old idyllic ease\nBeneath St. François' hemlock-trees;\nAgain for him the moonlight shone\nOn Norman cap and bodiced zone;\nAgain he heard the violin play\nWhich led the village dance away,\nAnd mingled in its merry whirl\nThe grandam and the laughing girl.\nOr, nearer home, our steps he led\nWhere Salisbury's level marshes spread\nMile-wide as flied the laden bee;\nWhere merry mowers, hale and strong,\nSwept, scythe on scythe, their swaths along\nThe low green prairies of the sea.\nWe shared the fishing off Boar's Head,\nAnd round the rocky Isles of Shoals\nThe hake-broil on the drift-wood coals;\nThe chowder on the sand-beach made,\nDipped by the hungry, steaming hot,\nWith spoons of clam-shell from the pot.\nWe heard the tales of witchcraft old,\nAnd dream and sign and marvel told\nTo sleepy listeners as they lay\nStretched idly on the salted hay,\nAdrift along the winding shores,\nWhen favoring breezes deigned to blow\nThe square sail of the gundelow\nAnd idle lay the useless oars.\n\nOur mother, while she turned her wheel\nOr run the new-knit stocking-heel,\nTold how the Indian hordes came down\nAt midnight on Concheco town,\nAnd how her own great-uncle bore\nHis cruel scalp-mark to fourscore.\nRecalling, in her fitting phrase,\nSo rich and picturesque and free\n(The common unrhymed poetry\nOf simple life and country ways),\nThe story of her early days, --\nShe made us welcome to her home;\nOld hearths grew wide to give us room;\nWe stole with her a frightened look\nAt the gray wizard's conjuring-book,\nThe fame whereof went far and wide\nThrough all the simple country side;\nWe heard the hawks at twilight play,\nThe boat-horn on Piscataqua,\nThe loon's weird laughter far away;\nWe fished her little trout-brook, knew\nWhat flowers in wood and meadow grew,\nWhat sunny hillsides autumn-brown\nShe climbed to shake the ripe nuts down,\nSaw where in sheltered cove and bay,\nThe ducks' black squadron anchored lay,\nAnd heard the wild-geese calling loud\nBeneath the gray November cloud.\nThen, haply, with a look more grave,\nAnd soberer tone, some tale she gave\nFrom painful Sewel's ancient tome,\nBeloved in every Quaker home,\nOf faith fire-winged by martyrdom,\nOr Chalkley's Journal, old and quaint, --\nGentlest of skippers, rare sea-saint! --\nWho, when the dreary calms prevailed,\nAnd water-butt and bread-cask failed,\nAnd cruel, hungry eyes pursued\nHis portly presence, mad for food,\nWith dark hints muttered under breath\nOf casting lots for life or death,\nOffered, if Heaven withheld supplies,\nTo be himself the sacrifice.\nThen, suddenly, as if to save\nThe good man from his living grave,\nA ripple on the water grew,\nA school of porpoise flashed in view.\n\"Take, eat,\" he said, \"and be content;\nThese fishes in my stead are sent\nBy Him who gave the tangled ram\nTo spare the child of Abraham.\"\n\nOur uncle, innocent of books,\nWas rich in lore of fields and brooks,\nThe ancient teachers never dumb\nOf Nature's unhoused lyceum.\nIn moons and tides and weather wise,\nHe read the clouds as prophecies,\nAnd foul or fair could well divine,\nBy many an occult hint and sign,\nHolding the cunning-warded keys\nTo all the woodcraft mysteries;\nHimself to Nature's heart so near\nThat all her voices in his ear\nOf beast or bird had meanings clear,\nLike Apollonius of old,\nWho knew the tales the sparrows told,\nOr Hermes, who interpreted\nWhat the sage cranes of Nilus said;\nA simple, guileless, childlike man,\nContent to live where life began;\nStrong only on his native grounds,\nThe little world of sights and sounds\nWhose girdle was the parish bounds,\nWhereof his fondly partial pride\nThe common features magnified,\nAs Surrey hills to mountains grew\nIn White of Selborne's loving view, --\nHe told how teal and loon he shot,\nAnd how the eagle's eggs he got,\nThe feats on pond and river done,\nThe prodigies of rod and gun;\nTill, warming with the tales he told,\nForgotten was the outside cold,\nThe bitter wind unheeded blew,\nFrom ripening corn the pigeons flew,\nThe partridge drummed i' the wood, the mink\nWent fishing down the river-brink.\nThe woodchuck, like a hermit gray,\nPeered from the doorway of his cell;\nThe muskrat plied the mason's trade,\nAnd tier by tier his mud-walls laid;\nAnd from the shagbark overhead\nThe grizzled squirrel dropped his shell.\n\nNext, the dear aunt, whose smile of cheer\nAnd voice in dreams I see and hear, --\nThe sweetest woman ever Fate\nPerverse denied a household mate,\nWho, lonely, homeless, not the less\nFound peace in love's unselfishness,\nAnd welcome wheresoe'er she went,\nA calm and gracious element,\nWhose presence seemed the sweet income\nAnd womanly atmosphere of home, --\nCalled up her girlhood memories,\nThe huskings and the apple-bees,\nThe sleigh-rides and the summer sails,\nWeaving through all the poor details\nAnd homespuun warp of circumstance\nA golden woof-thread of romance.\nFor well she kept her genial mood\nAnd simple faith of maidenhood;\nBefore her still a cloud-land lay,\nThe mirage loomed across her way;\nThe morning dew, that dries so soon\nWith others, glistened at her noon;\nThrough years of toil and soil and care,\nFrom glossy tress to thin gray hair,\nAll unprofaned she held apart\nThe virgin fancies of the heart.\nBe shame to him of woman born\nWho hath for such but thought of scorn.\n\nThere, too, our elder sister plied\nHer evening task the stand beside;\nA full, rich nature, free to trust,\nTruthful and almost sternly just,\nImpulsive, earnest, prompt to act,\nAnd make her generous thought a fact,\nKeeping with many a light disguise\nThe secret of self-sacrifice.\nO heart sore-tried! thou hast the best\nThat Heaven itself coud give thee, -- rest,\nRest from all bitter thoughts and things!\nHow many a poor one's blessing went\nWith thee beneath the low green tent\nWhose curtain never outward swings!\n\nAs one who held herself a part\nOf all she saw, and let her heart\nAgainst the household bosom lean,\nUpon the motley-braided mat\nOur yougest and our dearest sat,\nLifting her large, sweet, asking eyes,\nNow bathed in the unfading green\nAnd holy peace of Paradise.\nOh, looking from some heavenly hill,\nOr from the shade of saintly palms,\nOr silver reach of river calms,\nDo those large eyes behold me still?\nWith me one little year ago: --\nThe chill weight of the winter snow\nFor months upon her grave has lain;\nAnd now, when summer south-winds blow\nAnd brier and harebell bloom again,\nI tread the pleasant paths we trod,\nI see the violet-sprinkled sod\nWhereon she leaned, too frail and weak\nThe hillside flowers she loved to seek,\nYet following me where'er I went\nWith dark eyes full of love's content.\nThe birds are glad; the brier-rose fills\nThe air with sweetness; all the hills\nStretch green to June's unclouded sky;\nBut still I wait with ear and eye,\nFor something gone which should be nigh,\nA loss in all familiar things,\nIn flower that blooms, and bird that sings.\nAnd yet, dear heart! remembering thee,\nAm I not richer than of old?\nSafe in thy immortality,\nWhat change can reach the wealth I hold?\nWhat chnce can mar the pearl and gold\nThy love hath left in trust with me?\nAnd while in late life's late afternoon,\nWhere cool and long the shadows grow,\nI walk to meet the night that soon\nShall shape and shadow overflow,\nI cannot feel that thou art far,\nSince near at need the angels are;\nAnd when the sunset gates unbar,\nShall I not see thee waiting stand,\nAnd, white against the evening star,\nThe welcome of thy beckoning hand?\n\nBrisk wielder of the birch and rule,\nThe master of the local school\nHeld at the fire his favored place,\nIts warm glow lit a laughing face\nFresh-hued and fair, where scarce appeared\nThe uncertain prophecy of beard.\nHe teased the mitten-blinded cat,\nPlayed cross-pins on my uncle's hat,\nSang songs, and told us what befalls\nIn classic Dartmouth's college halls.\nBorn the wild Northern hills among,\nFrom whence his yeoman father wrung\nBy patient toil subsistence scant,\nNot competence and yet not want,\nHe early gained the power to pay\nHis cheerful, self-reliant way;\nCould doff at ease his scholar's gown\nTo peddle wares from town to town;\nOr through the long vacation's reach\nIn lonely lowland districts teach,\nWhere all the droll experience found\nAt stranger hearths in boarding round,\nThe moonlit skater's keen delight,\nThe sleigh-drive through the frosty night,\nThe rustic party, with its rough\nAccompaniment of blind-man's-buff,\nAnd whirling-plate, and forfeits paid,\nHis winter task a pastime made.\nHappy the snow-locked homes wherein\nHe tuned his merry violin,\nOr played the athlete in the barn,\nOr held the good dame's winding-yarn,\nOr mirth-provoking versions told\nOf classic legends rare and old,\nWherein the scenes of Greece and Rome\nHad all the commonplace of home,\nAnd little seemed at best the odds\n'Twixt Yankee pedlers and old gods;\nWhere Pindus-born Arachthus took\nThe guise of any grist-mill brok,\nAnd dread Olympus at his will\nBecame a huckleberry hill.\n\nA careless boy that night he seemed;\nBut at his desk he had the look\nAnd air of one who wisely schemed,\nAnd hostage from the future took\nIn trainëd thought and lore of book.\nLarge-brained, clear-eyed, of such as he\nShall Freedom's young apostles be,\nWho, following in War's bloody trail,\nShall every lingering wrong assail;\nAll chains from limb and spirit strike,\nUplift the black and white alike;\nScatter before their swift advance\nThe darkness and the ignorance,\nThe pride, the lust, the squalid sloth,\nWhich nurtured Treason's monstrous growth,\nMade murder pastime, and the hell\nOf prison-torture possible;\nThe cruel lie of caste refute,\nOld forms remould, and substitute\nFor Slavery's lash the freeman's will,\nFor blind routine, wise-handed skill;\nA school-house plant on every hill,\nStretching in radiate nerve-lines thence\nThe quick wires of intelligence;\nTill North and South together brought\nShall own the same electric thought,\nIn peace a common flag salute,\nAnd, side by side in labor's free\nAnd unresentful revalry,\nHarvest the fields wherein they fought.\n\nAnother guest that winter night\nFlashed back from lustrous eyes the light.\nUnmarked by time, and yet not young,\nThe honeyed music of her tongue\nAnd words of meekness scarcely told\nA nature passionate and bold,\nStrong, self-concentred, spurning guide,\nIts milder features dwarded beside\nHer unbent will's majestic pride.\nShe sat among us, at the test,\nA not unfeared, half-welcome guest,\nRebuking with her cultured phrase\nOur homeliness of words and ways.\nA certain pard-like, treacherous grace\nSwayed the lithe limbs and dropped the lash,\nLent the white teeth their dazzling flash;\nAnd under low brows, black with night,\nRayed out at times a dangerous light;\nThe sharp heat-lightnings of her face\nPresaging ill to him whom Fate\nCondemned to share her love or hate.\nA woman tropical, intense\nIn thought and act, in soul and sense,\nShe blended in a like degree\nThe vixen and the devotee,\nRevealing with each freak of feint\nThe temper of Petruchio's Kate,\nThe raptures of Siena's saint.\nHer tapering hand and rounded wrist\nHad facile power to form a fist;\nThe warm, dark languish of her eyes\nWas never safe from wrath's surprise.\nBrows saintly calm and lips devout\nKnew every change of scowl and pout;\nAnd the sweet voice had notes more high\nAnd shrill for social battle-cry.\n\nSince then what old cathedral town\nHas missed her pilgrim staff and gown,\nWhat convent-gate has held its lock\nAgainst the challenge of her knock!\nThrough Smyrna's plague-hushed thoroughfares,\nUp sea-set Malta's rocky stair,\nGray olive slopes of hills that hem\nThy tombs and shrines, Jerusalem,\nOr startling on her desert throne\nThe crazy Queen of Lebanon\nWith claims fantastic as her own,\nHer tireless feet have held their way;\nAnd still, unrestful. bowed, and gray,\nShe watches under Eastern skies,\nWith hope each day renewed and fresh,\nThe Lord's quick coming in the flesh,\nWhereof she dreams and prophecies!\n\nWhere'er her troubled path may be,\nThe Lord's sweet pity with her go!\nThe outward wayward life we see,\nThe hidden springs we may not know.\nNor is it given us to discern\nWhat threads the fatal sisters spun,\nThrough what ancestral years has run\nThe sorrow with the woman born,\nWhat forged her cruel chain of moods,\nWhat set her feet in solitudes,\nAnd held the love within her mute,\nWhat mingled madness in the blood\nA life-long discord and annoy,\nWater of tears with oil of joy,\nAnd hid within the folded bud\nPeversities of flower and fruit.\nIt is not ours to separate\nThe tangled skien of will and fate,\nTo show what metes and bounds should stand\nUpon the soul's debatable land,\nAnd between choice and Providence\nDivide the circle of events;\nBut He who knows our frame is just,\nMerciful and compassionate,\nAnd full of sweet assurances\nAnd hope for all the language is,\nThat He remembereth we are dust!\n\nAt last the great logs, crumbling low,\nSent out a dull and duller glow,\nThe bull's-eye watch that hung in view,\nTicking its weary circuit through,\nPointed with mutely warning sign\nIts black hand to the hour of nine.\nThat sign the pleasant circle. broke:\nMy uncle ceased his pipe to smoke,\nKnocked from its bowl the refuse gray\nAnd laid it tenderly away;\nThen roused himself to safely cover\nThe dull red brands with ashes over,\nAnd while, with care, our mother laid\nThe work aside, her steps she stayed\nOne moment, seeking to express\nHer grateful sense of happiness\nFor food and shelter, warmth and health,\nAnd love's contentment more than wealth,\nWith simple wishes (not the weak,\nVain prayers which no fulfilment seek,\nBut such as warm the generous heart,\nO'er-prompt to do with Heaven its part)\nThat none might lack, that bitter night,\nFor bread and clothing, warmth and light.\n\nWithin our beds awhile we heard\nThe wind that round the gables roared,\nWith now and then a ruder shock,\nWhich made our very bedsteads rock.\nWe heard the loosened clapboards tost,\nThe board-nails snapping in the frost;\nAnd on us, through the unplastered wall,\nFelt the light sifted snow-flakes fall.\nBut sleep stole on, as sleep will do\nWhen hearts are light and life is new;\nFaint and more faint the murmurs grew,\nTill in the summer-land of dreams\nThey softened to the sound of streams,\nLow stir of leaves, and dip of oars,\nAnd lapsing waves on quiet shores.\n\nNext morn we wakened with the shout\nOf merry voices high and clear;\nAnd saw the teamsters drawing near\nTo break the drifted highways out.\nDown the long hillside treading slow\nWe saw the half-buried oxen go,\nShaking the snow from heads uptost,\nTheir straining nostrils white with frost.\nBefore our door the stragglins train\nDrew up, an added team to gain.\nThe elders threshed their hands a-cold,\nPassed, with the cider-mug, their jokes\nFrom lip to lip; the younger folks\nDown the loose snow-banks, wrestling rolled,\nThen toiled again the cavalcade\nO'er windy hill, through clogged ravine,\nAnd woodland paths that wound between\nLow drooping pine-boughs winter-weighed.\nFrom every barn a team afoot,\nAt every house a new recruit,\nWhere, drawn by Nature's subtlest law,\nHaply the watchful young men saw\nSweet doorway pictures of the curls\nAnd curious eyes of merry girls,\nLifting their hands in mock defence\nAgainst the snow-ball's compliments,\nAnd reading in each missive tost\nThe charm with Eden never lost.\n\nWe heard once more the sleigh-bells' sound;\nAnd, following where the teamsters led,\nThe wise old Doctor went his round,\nJust pausing at our door to say,\nIn the brief autocratic way\nOf one who, prompt at Duty's call\nWas free to urge her claim on all,\nThat some poor neighbor sick abed\nAt night our mother's aid would need.\nFor, one in generous thought and deed\nWhat mattered in the sufferer's sight\nThe Quaker matron's inward light,\nThe Doctor's mail of Calvin's creed?\nAll hearts confess the saints elect\nWho, twain in faith, in love agree,\nAnd melt not in an acid sect\nThe Christian pearl of charity!\n\nSo days went on: a week had passed\nSince the great world was heard from last.\nThe Almanac we studied o'er,\nRead and reread our little store\nOf books and pamphlets, scarce a score;\nOne harmless novel, mostly hid\nFrom younger eyes, a book forbid,\nAnd poetry (or good or bad,\nA single book was all we had),\nWhere Ellwood's meek, drab-skirted Muse,\nA stranger to the heathen Nine,\nSang, with a somewhat nasal whine,\nThe wars of David and the Jews.\nAt last the flourndering carrier bore\nThe village paper to our door.\nLo! broadening outward as we read,\nTo warmer zones the horizon spread;\nIn panoramic length unrolled\nWe saw the marvels that it told.\nBefore us passed the painted Creeks,\nAnd daft McGregor on his raids\nIn Costa Rica's everglades.\nAnd up Taygetos winding slow\nRode Ypsilanti's Mainote Greeks,\nA Turk's head at each saddle-bow!\nWelcome to us its week-old news,\nIts corner for the rustic Muse\nIts monthly gauge of snow and rain,\nIts record, mingling in a breath\nThe wedding bell and dirge of death:\nJest, anecdote, and love-lorn tale,\nThe latest culprit sent to jail;\nIts hue and cry of stolen and lost,\nIts vendue sales and goods at cost,\nAnd traffic calling loud for gain.\nWe felt the stir of hall and street,\nThe pulse of life that round us beat;\nThe chill embargo of the snow\nWas melted in the genial glow;\nWide swung again our ice-locked door,\nAnd all the world was ours once more!\n\nClasp, Angel of the backword look\nAnd folded wings of ashen gray\nAnd voice of echoes far away,\nThe brazen covers of thy book;\nThe weird palimpsest old and vast,\nWherein thou hid'st the spectral past;\nWhere, closely mingling, pale and glow\nThe characters of joy and woe;\nThe monographs of outlived years,\nOr smile-illumed or dim with tears,\nGreen hills of life that slope to death,\nAnd haunts of home, whose vistaed trees\nShade off to mournful cypresses,\nWith the white amaranths underneath.\nEven while I look, I can but heed\nThe restless sands' incessant fall,\nImportunate hours that hours succeed\nEach clamorous with its own sharp need,\nAnd duty keeping pace with all.\nShut down and clasp with heavy lids;\nI hear again the voice that bids\nThe dreamer leave his dream midway\nFor larger hopes and graver fears:\nLife greatens in these later years,\nThe century's aloe flowers to-day!\n\nYet, haply, in some lull of life,\nSome Truce of God which breaks its strife,\nThe wordling's eyes shall gather dew,\nDreaming in throngful city ways\nOf winter joys his boyhood knew;\nAnd dear and early friends -- the few\nWho yet remain -- shall pause to view\nThese Flemish pictures of old days;\nSit with me by the homestead hearth\nAnd stretch the hands of memory forth\nTo warm them at the wood-fire's blaze!\nAnd thanks untraced to lips unknown\nShall greet me like the odors blown\nFrom unseen meadows newly mown,\nOr lilies floating in some pond,\nWood-fringed, the wayside gaze beyond;\nThe traveller owns the grateful sense\nOf sweetness near, he knows not whence,\nAnd, pausing takes with forehead bare\nThe benediction of the air.","title":"Snowbound, a Winter Idyl"},{"lines":"\"Tie stille, barn min!\nImorgen kommer Fin,\nFa'er din,\nOg gi'er dich Esbern Snares öine og hjerte at lege med!\"\nZealand Rhyme.\n\n\n\"BUILD at

Up led by thee\nInto the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,\nAn earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air,\nThy tempering: with like safety guided down\nReturn me to my native element:\nLest from this flying steed unreined, (as once\nBellerophon, though from a lower clime,)\nDismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,\nErroneous there to wander, and forlorn.\nHalf yet remains unsung, but narrower bound\nWithin the visible diurnal sphere;\nStanding on earth, not rapt above the pole,\nMore safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged\nTo hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,\nOn evil days though fallen, and evil tongues;\nIn darkness, and with dangers compassed round,\nAnd solitude; yet not alone, while thou\nVisitest my slumbers nightly, or when morn\nPurples the east: still govern thou my song,\nUrania, and fit audience find, though few.\nBut drive far off the barbarous dissonance\nOf Bacchus and his revellers, the race\nOf that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard\nIn Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears\nTo rapture, till the savage clamour drowned\nBoth harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend\nHer son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores:\nFor thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.\nSay, Goddess, what ensued when Raphael,\nThe affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned\nAdam, by dire example, to beware\nApostasy, by what befel in Heaven\nTo those apostates; lest the like befall\nIn Paradise to Adam or his race,\nCharged not to touch the interdicted tree,\nIf they transgress, and slight that sole command,\nSo easily obeyed amid the choice\nOf all tastes else to please their appetite,\nThough wandering.  He, with his consorted Eve,\nThe story heard attentive, and was filled\nWith admiration and deep muse, to hear\nOf things so high and strange; things, to their thought\nSo unimaginable, as hate in Heaven,\nAnd war so near the peace of God in bliss,\nWith such confusion: but the evil, soon\nDriven back, redounded as a flood on those\nFrom whom it sprung; impossible to mix\nWith blessedness.  Whence Adam soon repealed\nThe doubts that in his heart arose: and now\nLed on, yet sinless, with desire to know\nWhat nearer might concern him, how this world\nOf Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began;\nWhen, and whereof created; for what cause;\nWhat within Eden, or without, was done\nBefore his memory; as one whose drouth\nYet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream,\nWhose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,\nProceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest.\nGreat things, and full of wonder in our ears,\nFar differing from this world, thou hast revealed,\nDivine interpreter! by favour sent\nDown from the empyrean, to forewarn\nUs timely of what might else have been our loss,\nUnknown, which human knowledge could not reach;\nFor which to the infinitely Good we owe\nImmortal thanks, and his admonishment\nReceive, with solemn purpose to observe\nImmutably his sovran will, the end\nOf what we are.  But since thou hast vouchsafed\nGently, for our instruction, to impart\nThings above earthly thought, which yet concerned\nOur knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed,\nDeign to descend now lower, and relate\nWhat may no less perhaps avail us known,\nHow first began this Heaven which we behold\nDistant so high, with moving fires adorned\nInnumerable; and this which yields or fills\nAll space, the ambient air wide interfused\nEmbracing round this floried Earth; what cause\nMoved the Creator, in his holy rest\nThrough all eternity, so late to build\nIn Chaos; and the work begun, how soon\nAbsolved; if unforbid thou mayest unfold\nWhat we, not to explore the secrets ask\nOf his eternal empire, but the more\nTo magnify his works, the more we know.\nAnd the great light of day yet wants to run\nMuch of his race though steep; suspense in Heaven,\nHeld by thy voice, thy potent voice, he hears,\nAnd longer will delay to hear thee tell\nHis generation, and the rising birth\nOf Nature from the unapparent Deep:\nOr if the star of evening and the moon\nHaste to thy audience, Night with her will bring,\nSilence; and Sleep, listening to thee, will watch;\nOr we can bid his absence, till thy song\nEnd, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine.\nThus Adam his illustrious guest besought:\nAnd thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.\nThis also thy request, with caution asked,\nObtain; though to recount almighty works\nWhat words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,\nOr heart of man suffice to comprehend?\nYet what thou canst attain, which best may serve\nTo glorify the Maker, and infer\nThee also happier, shall not be withheld\nThy hearing; such commission from above\nI have received, to answer thy desire\nOf knowledge within bounds; beyond, abstain\nTo ask; nor let thine own inventions hope\nThings not revealed, which the invisible King,\nOnly Omniscient, hath suppressed in night;\nTo none communicable in Earth or Heaven:\nEnough is left besides to search and know.\nBut knowledge is as food, and needs no less\nHer temperance over appetite, to know\nIn measure what the mind may well contain;\nOppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns\nWisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind.\nKnow then, that, after Lucifer from Heaven\n(So call him, brighter once amidst the host\nOf Angels, than that star the stars among,)\nFell with his flaming legions through the deep\nInto his place, and the great Son returned\nVictorious with his Saints, the Omnipotent\nEternal Father from his throne beheld\nTheir multitude, and to his Son thus spake.\nAt least our envious Foe hath failed, who thought\nAll like himself rebellious, by whose aid\nThis inaccessible high strength, the seat\nOf Deity supreme, us dispossessed,\nHe trusted to have seised, and into fraud\nDrew many, whom their place knows here no more:\nYet far the greater part have kept, I see,\nTheir station; Heaven, yet populous, retains\nNumber sufficient to possess her realms\nThough wide, and this high temple to frequent\nWith ministeries due, and solemn rites:\nBut, lest his heart exalt him in the harm\nAlready done, to have dispeopled Heaven,\nMy damage fondly deemed, I can repair\nThat detriment, if such it be to lose\nSelf-lost; and in a moment will create\nAnother world, out of one man a race\nOf men innumerable, there to dwell,\nNot here; till, by degrees of merit raised,\nThey open to themselves at length the way\nUp hither, under long obedience tried;\nAnd Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth,\nOne kingdom, joy and union without end.\nMean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven;\nAnd thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee\nThis I perform; speak thou, and be it done!\nMy overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee\nI send along; ride forth, and bid the Deep\nWithin appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth;\nBoundless the Deep, because I Am who fill\nInfinitude, nor vacuous the space.\nThough I, uncircumscribed myself, retire,\nAnd put not forth my goodness, which is free\nTo act or not, Necessity and Chance\nApproach not me, and what I will is Fate.\nSo spake the Almighty, and to what he spake\nHis Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.\nImmediate are the acts of God, more swift\nThan time or motion, but to human ears\nCannot without process of speech be told,\nSo told as earthly notion can receive.\nGreat triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven,\nWhen such was heard declared the Almighty's will;\nGlory they sung to the Most High, good will\nTo future men, and in their dwellings peace;\nGlory to Him, whose just avenging ire\nHad driven out the ungodly from his sight\nAnd the habitations of the just; to Him\nGlory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained\nGood out of evil to create; instead\nOf Spirits malign, a better race to bring\nInto their vacant room, and thence diffuse\nHis good to worlds and ages infinite.\nSo sang the Hierarchies:  Mean while the Son\nOn his great expedition now appeared,\nGirt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned\nOf Majesty Divine; sapience and love\nImmense, and all his Father in him shone.\nAbout his chariot numberless were poured\nCherub, and Seraph, Potentates, and Thrones,\nAnd Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged\nFrom the armoury of God; where stand of old\nMyriads, between two brazen mountains lodged\nAgainst a solemn day, harnessed at hand,\nCelestial equipage; and now came forth\nSpontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,\nAttendant on their Lord:  Heaven opened wide\nHer ever-during gates, harmonious sound\nOn golden hinges moving, to let forth\nThe King of Glory, in his powerful Word\nAnd Spirit, coming to create new worlds.\nOn heavenly ground they stood; and from the shore\nThey viewed the vast immeasurable abyss\nOutrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,\nUp from the bottom turned by furious winds\nAnd surging waves, as mountains, to assault\nHeaven's highth, and with the center mix the pole.\nSilence, ye troubled Waves, and thou Deep, peace,\nSaid then the Omnifick Word; your discord end!\nNor staid; but, on the wings of Cherubim\nUplifted, in paternal glory rode\nFar into Chaos, and the world unborn;\nFor Chaos heard his voice:  Him all his train\nFollowed in bright procession, to behold\nCreation, and the wonders of his might.\nThen staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand\nHe took the golden compasses, prepared\nIn God's eternal store, to circumscribe\nThis universe, and all created things:\nOne foot he centered, and the other turned\nRound through the vast profundity obscure;\nAnd said, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds,\nThis be thy just circumference, O World!\nThus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth,\nMatter unformed and void:  Darkness profound\nCovered the abyss: but on the watery calm\nHis brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,\nAnd vital virtue infused, and vital warmth\nThroughout the fluid mass; but downward purged\nThe black tartareous cold infernal dregs,\nAdverse to life: then founded, then conglobed\nLike things to like; the rest to several place\nDisparted, and between spun out the air;\nAnd Earth self-balanced on her center hung.\nLet there be light, said God; and forthwith Light\nEthereal, first of things, quintessence pure,\nSprung from the deep; and from her native east\nTo journey through the aery gloom began,\nSphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun\nWas not; she in a cloudy tabernacle\nSojourned the while.  God saw the light was good;\nAnd light from darkness by the hemisphere\nDivided: light the Day, and darkness Night,\nHe named.  Thus was the first day even and morn:\nNor past uncelebrated, nor unsung\nBy the celestial quires, when orient light\nExhaling first from darkness they beheld;\nBirth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout\nThe hollow universal orb they filled,\nAnd touched their golden harps, and hymning praised\nGod and his works; Creator him they sung,\nBoth when first evening was, and when first morn.\nAgain, God said,  Let there be firmament\nAmid the waters, and let it divide\nThe waters from the waters; and God made\nThe firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,\nTransparent, elemental air, diffused\nIn circuit to the uttermost convex\nOf this great round; partition firm and sure,\nThe waters underneath from those above\nDividing: for as earth, so he the world\nBuilt on circumfluous waters calm, in wide\nCrystalline ocean, and the loud misrule\nOf Chaos far removed; lest fierce extremes\nContiguous might distemper the whole frame:\nAnd Heaven he named the Firmament:  So even\nAnd morning chorus sung the second day.\nThe Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet\nOf waters, embryon immature involved,\nAppeared not: over all the face of Earth\nMain ocean flowed, not idle; but, with warm\nProlifick humour softening all her globe,\nFermented the great mother to conceive,\nSatiate with genial moisture; when God said,\nBe gathered now ye waters under Heaven\nInto one place, and let dry land appear.\nImmediately the mountains huge appear\nEmergent, and their broad bare backs upheave\nInto the clouds; their tops ascend the sky:\nSo high as heaved the tumid hills, so low\nDown sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,\nCapacious bed of waters:  Thither they\nHasted with glad precipitance, uprolled,\nAs drops on dust conglobing from the dry:\nPart rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct,\nFor haste; such flight the great command impressed\nOn the swift floods:  As armies at the call\nOf trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard)\nTroop to their standard; so the watery throng,\nWave rolling after wave, where way they found,\nIf steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain,\nSoft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill;\nBut they, or under ground, or circuit wide\nWith serpent errour wandering, found their way,\nAnd on the washy oose deep channels wore;\nEasy, ere God had bid the ground be dry,\nAll but within those banks, where rivers now\nStream, and perpetual draw their humid train.\nThe dry land, Earth; and the great receptacle\nOf congregated waters, he called Seas:\nAnd saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth\nPut forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed,\nAnd fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind,\nWhose seed is in herself upon the Earth.\nHe scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then\nDesart and bare, unsightly, unadorned,\nBrought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad\nHer universal face with pleasant green;\nThen herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered\nOpening their various colours, and made gay\nHer bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown,\nForth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept\nThe swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed\nEmbattled in her field, and the humble shrub,\nAnd bush with frizzled hair implicit:  Last\nRose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread\nTheir branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed\nTheir blossoms:  With high woods the hills were crowned;\nWith tufts the valleys, and each fountain side;\nWith borders long the rivers: that Earth now\nSeemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell,\nOr wander with delight, and love to haunt\nHer sacred shades: though God had yet not rained\nUpon the Earth, and man to till the ground\nNone was; but from the Earth a dewy mist\nWent up, and watered all the ground, and each\nPlant of the field; which, ere it was in the Earth,\nGod made, and every herb, before it grew\nOn the green stem:  God saw that it was good:\nSo even and morn recorded the third day.\nAgain the Almighty spake, Let there be lights\nHigh in the expanse of Heaven, to divide\nThe day from night; and let them be for signs,\nFor seasons, and for days, and circling years;\nAnd let them be for lights, as I ordain\nTheir office in the firmament of Heaven,\nTo give light on the Earth; and it was so.\nAnd God made two great lights, great for their use\nTo Man, the greater to have rule by day,\nThe less by night, altern; and made the stars,\nAnd set them in the firmament of Heaven\nTo illuminate the Earth, and rule the day\nIn their vicissitude, and rule the night,\nAnd light from darkness to divide.  God saw,\nSurveying his great work, that it was good:\nFor of celestial bodies first the sun\nA mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first,\nThough of ethereal mould: then formed the moon\nGlobose, and every magnitude of stars,\nAnd sowed with stars the Heaven, thick as a field:\nOf light by far the greater part he took,\nTransplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed\nIn the sun's orb, made porous to receive\nAnd drink the liquid light; firm to retain\nHer gathered beams, great palace now of light.\nHither, as to their fountain, other stars\nRepairing, in their golden urns draw light,\nAnd hence the morning-planet gilds her horns;\nBy tincture or reflection they augment\nTheir small peculiar, though from human sight\nSo far remote, with diminution seen,\nFirst in his east the glorious lamp was seen,\nRegent of day, and all the horizon round\nInvested with bright rays, jocund to run\nHis longitude through Heaven's high road; the gray\nDawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced,\nShedding sweet influence:  Less bright the moon,\nBut opposite in levelled west was set,\nHis mirrour, with full face borrowing her light\nFrom him; for other light she needed none\nIn that aspect, and still that distance keeps\nTill night; then in the east her turn she shines,\nRevolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign\nWith thousand lesser lights dividual holds,\nWith thousand thousand stars, that then appeared\nSpangling the hemisphere:  Then first adorned\nWith their bright luminaries that set and rose,\nGlad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day.\nAnd God said, Let the waters generate\nReptile with spawn abundant, living soul:\nAnd let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings\nDisplayed on the open firmament of Heaven.\nAnd God created the great whales, and each\nSoul living, each that crept, which plenteously\nThe waters generated by their kinds;\nAnd every bird of wing after his kind;\nAnd saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying.\nBe fruitful, multiply, and in the seas,\nAnd lakes, and running streams, the waters fill;\nAnd let the fowl be multiplied, on the Earth.\nForthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay,\nWith fry innumerable swarm, and shoals\nOf fish that with their fins, and shining scales,\nGlide under the green wave, in sculls that oft\nBank the mid sea: part single, or with mate,\nGraze the sea-weed their pasture, and through groves\nOf coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance,\nShow to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold;\nOr, in their pearly shells at ease, attend\nMoist nutriment; or under rocks their food\nIn jointed armour watch: on smooth the seal\nAnd bended dolphins play: part huge of bulk\nWallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait,\nTempest the ocean: there leviathan,\nHugest of living creatures, on the deep\nStretched like a promontory sleeps or swims,\nAnd seems a moving land; and at his gills\nDraws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea.\nMean while the tepid caves, and fens, and shores,\nTheir brood as numerous hatch, from the egg that soon\nBursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed\nTheir callow young; but feathered soon and fledge\nThey summed their pens; and, soaring the air sublime,\nWith clang despised the ground, under a cloud\nIn prospect; there the eagle and the stork\nOn cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build:\nPart loosely wing the region, part more wise\nIn common, ranged in figure, wedge their way,\nIntelligent of seasons, and set forth\nTheir aery caravan, high over seas\nFlying, and over lands, with mutual wing\nEasing their flight; so steers the prudent crane\nHer annual voyage, borne on winds; the air\nFloats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes:\nFrom branch to branch the smaller birds with song\nSolaced the woods, and spread their painted wings\nTill even; nor then the solemn nightingale\nCeased warbling, but all night tun'd her soft lays:\nOthers, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed\nTheir downy breast; the swan with arched neck,\nBetween her white wings mantling proudly, rows\nHer state with oary feet; yet oft they quit\nThe dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower\nThe mid aereal sky:  Others on ground\nWalked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds\nThe silent hours, and the other whose gay train\nAdorns him, coloured with the florid hue\nOf rainbows and starry eyes.  The waters thus\nWith fish replenished, and the air with fowl,\nEvening and morn solemnized the fifth day.\nThe sixth, and of creation last, arose\nWith evening harps and matin; when God said,\nLet the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind,\nCattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth,\nEach in their kind.  The Earth obeyed, and straight\nOpening her fertile womb teemed at a birth\nInnumerous living creatures, perfect forms,\nLimbed and full grown:  Out of the ground up rose,\nAs from his lair, the wild beast where he wons\nIn forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den;\nAmong the trees in pairs they rose, they walked:\nThe cattle in the fields and meadows green:\nThose rare and solitary, these in flocks\nPasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung.\nThe grassy clods now calved; now half appeared\nThe tawny lion, pawing to get free\nHis hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds,\nAnd rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce,\nThe libbard, and the tiger, as the mole\nRising, the crumbled earth above them threw\nIn hillocks:  The swift stag from under ground\nBore up his branching head:  Scarce from his mould\nBehemoth biggest born of earth upheaved\nHis vastness:  Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose,\nAs plants:  Ambiguous between sea and land\nThe river-horse, and scaly crocodile.\nAt once came forth whatever creeps the ground,\nInsect or worm: those waved their limber fans\nFor wings, and smallest lineaments exact\nIn all the liveries decked of summer's pride\nWith spots of gold and purple, azure and green:\nThese, as a line, their long dimension drew,\nStreaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all\nMinims of nature; some of serpent-kind,\nWonderous in length and corpulence, involved\nTheir snaky folds, and added wings.  First crept\nThe parsimonious emmet, provident\nOf future; in small room large heart enclosed;\nPattern of just equality perhaps\nHereafter, joined in her popular tribes\nOf commonalty:  Swarming next appeared\nThe female bee, that feeds her husband drone\nDeliciously, and builds her waxen cells\nWith honey stored:  The rest are numberless,\nAnd thou their natures knowest, and gavest them names,\nNeedless to thee repeated; nor unknown\nThe serpent, subtlest beast of all the field,\nOf huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes\nAnd hairy mane terrifick, though to thee\nNot noxious, but obedient at thy call.\nNow Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled\nHer motions, as the great first Mover's hand\nFirst wheeled their course:  Earth in her rich attire\nConsummate lovely smiled; air, water, earth,\nBy fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked,\nFrequent; and of the sixth day yet remained:\nThere wanted yet the master-work, the end\nOf all yet done; a creature, who, not prone\nAnd brute as other creatures, but endued\nWith sanctity of reason, might erect\nHis stature, and upright with front serene\nGovern the rest, self-knowing; and from thence\nMagnanimous to correspond with Heaven,\nBut grateful to acknowledge whence his good\nDescends, thither with heart, and voice, and eyes\nDirected in devotion, to adore\nAnd worship God Supreme, who made him chief\nOf all his works:  therefore the Omnipotent\nEternal Father (for where is not he\nPresent?) thus to his Son audibly spake.\nLet us make now Man in our image, Man\nIn our similitude, and let them rule\nOver the fish and fowl of sea and air,\nBeast of the field, and over all the Earth,\nAnd every creeping thing that creeps the ground.\nThis said, he formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man,\nDust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed\nThe breath of life; in his own image he\nCreated thee, in the image of God\nExpress; and thou becamest a living soul.\nMale he created thee; but thy consort\nFemale, for race; then blessed mankind, and said,\nBe fruitful, multiply, and fill the Earth;\nSubdue it, and throughout dominion hold\nOver fish of the sea, and fowl of the air,\nAnd every living thing that moves on the Earth.\nWherever thus created, for no place\nIs yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest,\nHe brought thee into this delicious grove,\nThis garden, planted with the trees of God,\nDelectable both to behold and taste;\nAnd freely all their pleasant fruit for food\nGave thee; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields,\nVariety without end; but of the tree,\nWhich, tasted, works knowledge of good and evil,\nThou mayest not; in the day thou eatest, thou diest;\nDeath is the penalty imposed; beware,\nAnd govern well thy appetite; lest Sin\nSurprise thee, and her black attendant Death.\nHere finished he, and all that he had made\nViewed, and behold all was entirely good;\nSo even and morn accomplished the sixth day:\nYet not till the Creator from his work\nDesisting, though unwearied, up returned,\nUp to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode;\nThence to behold this new created world,\nThe addition of his empire, how it showed\nIn prospect from his throne, how good, how fair,\nAnswering his great idea.  Up he rode\nFollowed with acclamation, and the sound\nSymphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned\nAngelick harmonies:  The earth, the air\nResounded, (thou rememberest, for thou heardst,)\nThe heavens and all the constellations rung,\nThe planets in their station listening stood,\nWhile the bright pomp ascended jubilant.\nOpen, ye everlasting gates! they sung,\nOpen, ye Heavens! your living doors;let in\nThe great Creator from his work returned\nMagnificent, his six days work, a World;\nOpen, and henceforth oft; for God will deign\nTo visit oft the dwellings of just men,\nDelighted; and with frequent intercourse\nThither will send his winged messengers\nOn errands of supernal grace.  So sung\nThe glorious train ascending:  He through Heaven,\nThat opened wide her blazing portals, led\nTo God's eternal house direct the way;\nA broad and ample road, whose dust is gold\nAnd pavement stars, as stars to thee appear,\nSeen in the galaxy, that milky way,\nWhich nightly, as a circling zone, thou seest\nPowdered with stars.  And now on Earth the seventh\nEvening arose in Eden, for the sun\nWas set, and twilight from the east came on,\nForerunning night; when at the holy mount\nOf Heaven's high-seated top, the imperial throne\nOf Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure,\nThe Filial Power arrived, and sat him down\nWith his great Father; for he also went\nInvisible, yet staid, (such privilege\nHath Omnipresence) and the work ordained,\nAuthor and End of all things; and, from work\nNow resting, blessed and hallowed the seventh day,\nAs resting on that day from all his work,\nBut not in silence holy kept: the harp\nHad work and rested not; the solemn pipe,\nAnd dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop,\nAll sounds on fret by string or golden wire,\nTempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice\nChoral or unison: of incense clouds,\nFuming from golden censers, hid the mount.\nCreation and the six days acts they sung:\nGreat are thy works, Jehovah! infinite\nThy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue\nRelate thee!  Greater now in thy return\nThan from the giant Angels:  Thee that day\nThy thunders magnified; but to create\nIs greater than created to destroy.\nWho can impair thee, Mighty King, or bound\nThy empire!  Easily the proud attempt\nOf Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain,\nThou hast repelled; while impiously they thought\nThee to diminish, and from thee withdraw\nThe number of thy worshippers.  Who seeks\nTo lessen thee, against his purpose serves\nTo manifest the more thy might: his evil\nThou usest, and from thence createst more good.\nWitness this new-made world, another Heaven\nFrom Heaven-gate not far, founded in view\nOn the clear hyaline, the glassy sea;\nOf amplitude almost immense, with stars\nNumerous, and every star perhaps a world\nOf destined habitation; but thou knowest\nTheir seasons: among these the seat of Men,\nEarth, with her nether ocean circumfused,\nTheir pleasant dwelling-place.  Thrice happy Men,\nAnd sons of Men, whom God hath thus advanced!\nCreated in his image, there to dwell\nAnd worship him; and in reward to rule\nOver his works, on earth, in sea, or air,\nAnd multiply a race of worshippers\nHoly and just:  Thrice happy, if they know\nTheir happiness, and persevere upright!\nSo sung they, and the empyrean rung\nWith halleluiahs:  Thus was sabbath kept.\nAnd thy request think now fulfilled, that asked\nHow first this world and face of things began,\nAnd what before thy memory was done\nFrom the beginning; that posterity,\nInformed by thee, might know:  If else thou seekest\nAught, not surpassing human measure, say.","title":"Paradise Lost: Book 07"},{"lines":"How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,\nStoln on his wing my three and twentieth year!\nMy hasting days fly on wtih full career,\nBut my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.\nPerhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,\nThat I to manhood am arrived so near,\nAnd inward ripeness doth much less appear,\nThat some more timely-happy spirits endu'th.\nYet be it less or more, or soon or slow,\nIt shall be still in strictest measure even\nTo that same lot, however mean or high,\nToward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven;\nAll is, if I have grace to use it so,\nAs ever in my great Taskmaster's eye.","title":"How Soon Hath Time"},{"lines":"All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued,\nThrough Heaven's wide champain held his way; till Morn,\nWaked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand\nUnbarred the gates of light.  There is a cave\nWithin the mount of God, fast by his throne,\nWhere light and darkness in perpetual round\nLodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven\nGrateful vicissitude, like day and night;\nLight issues forth, and at the other door\nObsequious darkness enters, till her hour\nTo veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well\nSeem twilight here:  And now went forth the Morn\nSuch as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold\nEmpyreal; from before her vanished Night,\nShot through with orient beams; when all the plain\nCovered with thick embattled squadrons bright,\nChariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,\nReflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:\nWar he perceived, war in procinct; and found\nAlready known what he for news had thought\nTo have reported:  Gladly then he mixed\nAmong those friendly Powers, who him received\nWith joy and acclamations loud, that one,\nThat of so many myriads fallen, yet one\nReturned not lost.  On to the sacred hill\nThey led him high applauded, and present\nBefore the seat supreme; from whence a voice,\nFrom midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.\nServant of God. Well done; well hast thou fought\nThe better fight, who single hast maintained\nAgainst revolted multitudes the cause\nOf truth, in word mightier than they in arms;\nAnd for the testimony of truth hast borne\nUniversal reproach, far worse to bear\nThan violence; for this was all thy care\nTo stand approved in sight of God, though worlds\nJudged thee perverse:  The easier conquest now\nRemains thee, aided by this host of friends,\nBack on thy foes more glorious to return,\nThan scorned thou didst depart; and to subdue\nBy force, who reason for their law refuse,\nRight reason for their law, and for their King\nMessiah, who by right of merit reigns.\nGo, Michael, of celestial armies prince,\nAnd thou, in military prowess next,\nGabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons\nInvincible; lead forth my armed Saints,\nBy thousands and by millions, ranged for fight,\nEqual in number to that Godless crew\nRebellious:  Them with fire and hostile arms\nFearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven\nPursuing, drive them out from God and bliss,\nInto their place of punishment, the gulf\nOf Tartarus, which ready opens wide\nHis fiery Chaos to receive their fall.\nSo spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began\nTo darken all the hill, and smoke to roll\nIn dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign\nOf wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud\nEthereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow:\nAt which command the Powers militant,\nThat stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined\nOf union irresistible, moved on\nIn silence their bright legions, to the sound\nOf instrumental harmony, that breathed\nHeroick ardour to adventurous deeds\nUnder their God-like leaders, in the cause\nOf God and his Messiah.  On they move\nIndissolubly firm; nor obvious hill,\nNor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides\nTheir perfect ranks; for high above the ground\nTheir march was, and the passive air upbore\nTheir nimble tread; as when the total kind\nOf birds, in orderly array on wing,\nCame summoned over Eden to receive\nTheir names of thee; so over many a tract\nOf Heaven they marched, and many a province wide,\nTenfold the length of this terrene:  At last,\nFar in the horizon to the north appeared\nFrom skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched\nIn battailous aspect, and nearer view\nBristled with upright beams innumerable\nOf rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields\nVarious, with boastful argument portrayed,\nThe banded Powers of Satan hasting on\nWith furious expedition; for they weened\nThat self-same day, by fight or by surprise,\nTo win the mount of God, and on his throne\nTo set the Envier of his state, the proud\nAspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain\nIn the mid way:  Though strange to us it seemed\nAt first, that Angel should with Angel war,\nAnd in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet\nSo oft in festivals of joy and love\nUnanimous, as sons of one great Sire,\nHymning the Eternal Father:  But the shout\nOf battle now began, and rushing sound\nOf onset ended soon each milder thought.\nHigh in the midst, exalted as a God,\nThe Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat,\nIdol of majesty divine, enclosed\nWith flaming Cherubim, and golden shields;\nThen lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now\n\"twixt host and host but narrow space was left,\nA dreadful interval, and front to front\nPresented stood in terrible array\nOf hideous length:  Before the cloudy van,\nOn the rough edge of battle ere it joined,\nSatan, with vast and haughty strides advanced,\nCame towering, armed in adamant and gold;\nAbdiel that sight endured not, where he stood\nAmong the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,\nAnd thus his own undaunted heart explores.\nO Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest\nShould yet remain, where faith and realty\nRemain not:  Wherefore should not strength and might\nThere fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove\nWhere boldest, though to fight unconquerable?\nHis puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid,\nI mean to try, whose reason I have tried\nUnsound and false; nor is it aught but just,\nThat he, who in debate of truth hath won,\nShould win in arms, in both disputes alike\nVictor; though brutish that contest and foul,\nWhen reason hath to deal with force, yet so\nMost reason is that reason overcome.\nSo pondering, and from his armed peers\nForth stepping opposite, half-way he met\nHis daring foe, at this prevention more\nIncensed, and thus securely him defied.\nProud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached\nThe highth of thy aspiring unopposed,\nThe throne of God unguarded, and his side\nAbandoned, at the terrour of thy power\nOr potent tongue:  Fool!not to think how vain\nAgainst the Omnipotent to rise in arms;\nWho out of smallest things could, without end,\nHave raised incessant armies to defeat\nThy folly; or with solitary hand\nReaching beyond all limit, at one blow,\nUnaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed\nThy legions under darkness:  But thou seest\nAll are not of thy train; there be, who faith\nPrefer, and piety to God, though then\nTo thee not visible, when I alone\nSeemed in thy world erroneous to dissent\nFrom all:  My sect thou seest;now learn too late\nHow few sometimes may know, when thousands err.\nWhom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance,\nThus answered.  Ill for thee, but in wished hour\nOf my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest\nFrom flight, seditious Angel! to receive\nThy merited reward, the first assay\nOf this right hand provoked, since first that tongue,\nInspired with contradiction, durst oppose\nA third part of the Gods, in synod met\nTheir deities to assert; who, while they feel\nVigour divine within them, can allow\nOmnipotence to none.  But well thou comest\nBefore thy fellows, ambitious to win\nFrom me some plume, that thy success may show\nDestruction to the rest:  This pause between,\n(Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know,\nAt first I thought that Liberty and Heaven\nTo heavenly souls had been all one; but now\nI see that most through sloth had rather serve,\nMinistring Spirits, trained up in feast and song!\nSuch hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven,\nServility with freedom to contend,\nAs both their deeds compared this day shall prove.\nTo whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.\nApostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find\nOf erring, from the path of truth remote:\nUnjustly thou depravest it with the name\nOf servitude, to serve whom God ordains,\nOr Nature:  God and Nature bid the same,\nWhen he who rules is worthiest, and excels\nThem whom he governs.  This is servitude,\nTo serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled\nAgainst his worthier, as thine now serve thee,\nThyself not free, but to thyself enthralled;\nYet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid.\nReign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve\nIn Heaven God ever blest, and his divine\nBehests obey, worthiest to be obeyed;\nYet chains in Hell, not realms, expect:  Mean while\nFrom me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight,\nThis greeting on thy impious crest receive.\nSo saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,\nWhich hung not, but so swift with tempest fell\nOn the proud crest of Satan, that no sight,\nNor motion of swift thought, less could his shield,\nSuch ruin intercept:  Ten paces huge\nHe back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee\nHis massy spear upstaid; as if on earth\nWinds under ground, or waters forcing way,\nSidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat,\nHalf sunk with all his pines.  Amazement seised\nThe rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see\nThus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout,\nPresage of victory, and fierce desire\nOf battle:  Whereat Michael bid sound\nThe Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven\nIt sounded, and the faithful armies rung\nHosanna to the Highest:  Nor stood at gaze\nThe adverse legions, nor less hideous joined\nThe horrid shock.  Now storming fury rose,\nAnd clamour such as heard in Heaven till now\nWas never; arms on armour clashing brayed\nHorrible discord, and the madding wheels\nOf brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise\nOf conflict; over head the dismal hiss\nOf fiery darts in flaming vollies flew,\nAnd flying vaulted either host with fire.\nSo under fiery cope together rushed\nBoth battles main, with ruinous assault\nAnd inextinguishable rage.  All Heaven\nResounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth\nHad to her center shook.  What wonder? when\nMillions of fierce encountering Angels fought\nOn either side, the least of whom could wield\nThese elements, and arm him with the force\nOf all their regions:  How much more of power\nArmy against army numberless to raise\nDreadful combustion warring, and disturb,\nThough not destroy, their happy native seat;\nHad not the Eternal King Omnipotent,\nFrom his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled\nAnd limited their might; though numbered such\nAs each divided legion might have seemed\nA numerous host; in strength each armed hand\nA legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed\nEach warriour single as in chief, expert\nWhen to advance, or stand, or turn the sway\nOf battle, open when, and when to close\nThe ridges of grim war:  No thought of flight,\nNone of retreat, no unbecoming deed\nThat argued fear; each on himself relied,\nAs only in his arm the moment lay\nOf victory:  Deeds of eternal fame\nWere done, but infinite; for wide was spread\nThat war and various; sometimes on firm ground\nA standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,\nTormented all the air; all air seemed then\nConflicting fire.  Long time in even scale\nThe battle hung; till Satan, who that day\nProdigious power had shown, and met in arms\nNo equal, ranging through the dire attack\nOf fighting Seraphim confused, at length\nSaw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled\nSquadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway\nBrandished aloft, the horrid edge came down\nWide-wasting; such destruction to withstand\nHe hasted, and opposed the rocky orb\nOf tenfold adamant, his ample shield,\nA vast circumference.  At his approach\nThe great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil\nSurceased, and glad, as hoping here to end\nIntestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued\nOr captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown\nAnd visage all inflamed first thus began.\nAuthor of evil, unknown till thy revolt,\nUnnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest\nThese acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,\nThough heaviest by just measure on thyself,\nAnd thy  adherents:  How hast thou disturbed\nHeaven's blessed peace, and into nature brought\nMisery, uncreated till the crime\nOf thy rebellion! how hast thou instilled\nThy malice into thousands, once upright\nAnd faithful, now proved false!  But think not here\nTo trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out\nFrom all her confines.  Heaven, the seat of bliss,\nBrooks not the works of violence and war.\nHence then, and evil go with thee along,\nThy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell;\nThou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils,\nEre this avenging sword begin thy doom,\nOr some more sudden vengeance, winged from God,\nPrecipitate thee with augmented pain.\nSo spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus\nThe Adversary.  Nor think thou with wind\nOf aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds\nThou canst not.  Hast thou turned the least of these\nTo flight, or if to fall, but that they rise\nUnvanquished, easier to transact with me\nThat thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats\nTo chase me hence? err not, that so shall end\nThe strife which thou callest evil, but we style\nThe strife of glory; which we mean to win,\nOr turn this Heaven itself into the Hell\nThou fablest; here however to dwell free,\nIf not to reign:  Mean while thy utmost force,\nAnd join him named Almighty to thy aid,\nI fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.\nThey ended parle, and both addressed for fight\nUnspeakable; for who, though with the tongue\nOf Angels, can relate, or to what things\nLiken on earth conspicuous, that may lift\nHuman imagination to such highth\nOf Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed,\nStood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms,\nFit to decide the empire of great Heaven.\nNow waved their fiery swords, and in the air\nMade horrid circles; two broad suns their shields\nBlazed opposite, while Expectation stood\nIn horrour:  From each hand with speed retired,\nWhere erst was thickest fight, the angelick throng,\nAnd left large field, unsafe within the wind\nOf such commotion; such as, to set forth\nGreat things by small, if, nature's concord broke,\nAmong the constellations war were sprung,\nTwo planets, rushing from aspect malign\nOf fiercest opposition, in mid sky\nShould combat, and their jarring spheres confound.\nTogether both with next to almighty arm\nUp-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed\nThat might determine, and not need repeat,\nAs not of power at once; nor odds appeared\nIn might or swift prevention:  But the sword\nOf Michael from the armoury of God\nWas given him tempered so, that neither keen\nNor solid might resist that edge: it met\nThe sword of Satan, with steep force to smite\nDescending, and in half cut sheer; nor staid,\nBut with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared\nAll his right side:  Then Satan first knew pain,\nAnd writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore\nThe griding sword with discontinuous wound\nPassed through him:  But the ethereal substance closed,\nNot long divisible; and from the gash\nA stream of necturous humour issuing flowed\nSanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed,\nAnd all his armour stained, ere while so bright.\nForthwith on all sides to his aid was run\nBy Angels many and strong, who interposed\nDefence, while others bore him on their shields\nBack to his chariot, where it stood retired\nFrom off the files of war:  There they him laid\nGnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame,\nTo find himself not matchless, and his pride\nHumbled by such rebuke, so far beneath\nHis confidence to equal God in power.\nYet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout\nVital in every part, not as frail man\nIn entrails, heart of head, liver or reins,\nCannot but by annihilating die;\nNor in their liquid texture mortal wound\nReceive, no more than can the fluid air:\nAll heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear,\nAll intellect, all sense; and, as they please,\nThey limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size\nAssume, as?kikes them best, condense or rare.\nMean while in other parts like deeds deserved\nMemorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,\nAnd with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array\nOf Moloch, furious king; who him defied,\nAnd at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound\nThreatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven\nRefrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon\nDown cloven to the waist, with shattered arms\nAnd uncouth pain fled bellowing.  On each wing\nUriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe,\nThough huge, and in a rock of diamond armed,\nVanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai,\nTwo potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods\nDisdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,\nMangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail.\nNor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy\nThe atheist crew, but with redoubled blow\nAriel, and Arioch, and the violence\nOf Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew.\nI might relate of thousands, and their names\nEternize here on earth; but those elect\nAngels, contented with their fame in Heaven,\nSeek not the praise of men:  The other sort,\nIn might though wonderous and in acts of war,\nNor of renown less eager, yet by doom\nCancelled from Heaven and sacred memory,\nNameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.\nFor strength from truth divided, and from just,\nIllaudable, nought merits but dispraise\nAnd ignominy; yet to glory aspires\nVain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:\nTherefore eternal silence be their doom.\nAnd now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,\nWith many an inroad gored; deformed rout\nEntered, and foul disorder; all the ground\nWith shivered armour strown, and on a heap\nChariot and charioteer lay overturned,\nAnd fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled\nO'er-wearied, through the faint Satanick host\nDefensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,\nThen first with fear surprised, and sense of pain,\nFled ignominious, to such evil brought\nBy sin of disobedience; till that hour\nNot liable to fear, or flight, or pain.\nFar otherwise the inviolable Saints,\nIn cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire,\nInvulnerable, impenetrably armed;\nSuch high advantages their innocence\nGave them above their foes; not to have sinned,\nNot to have disobeyed; in fight they stood\nUnwearied, unobnoxious to be pained\nBy wound, though from their place by violence moved,\nNow Night her course began, and, over Heaven\nInducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,\nAnd silence on the odious din of war:\nUnder her cloudy covert both retired,\nVictor and vanquished:  On the foughten field\nMichael and his Angels prevalent\nEncamping, placed in guard their watches round,\nCherubick waving fires:  On the other part,\nSatan with his rebellious disappeared,\nFar in the dark dislodged; and, void of rest,\nHis potentates to council called by night;\nAnd in the midst thus undismayed began.\nO now in danger tried, now known in arms\nNot to be overpowered, Companions dear,\nFound worthy not of liberty alone,\nToo mean pretence! but what we more affect,\nHonour, dominion, glory, and renown;\nWho have sustained one day in doubtful fight,\n(And if one day, why not eternal days?)\nWhat Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send\nAgainst us from about his throne, and judged\nSufficient to subdue us to his will,\nBut proves not so:  Then fallible, it seems,\nOf future we may deem him, though till now\nOmniscient thought.  True is, less firmly armed,\nSome disadvantage we endured and pain,\nTill now not known, but, known, as soon contemned;\nSince now we find this our empyreal form\nIncapable of mortal injury,\nImperishable, and, though pierced with wound,\nSoon closing, and by native vigour healed.\nOf evil then so small as easy think\nThe remedy; perhaps more valid arms,\nWeapons more violent, when next we meet,\nMay serve to better us, and worse our foes,\nOr equal what between us made the odds,\nIn nature none:  If other hidden cause\nLeft them superiour, while we can preserve\nUnhurt our minds, and understanding sound,\nDue search and consultation will disclose.\nHe sat; and in the assembly next upstood\nNisroch, of Principalities the prime;\nAs one he stood escaped from cruel fight,\nSore toiled, his riven arms to havock hewn,\nAnd cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.\nDeliverer from new Lords, leader to free\nEnjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard\nFor Gods, and too unequal work we find,\nAgainst unequal arms to fight in pain,\nAgainst unpained, impassive; from which evil\nRuin must needs ensue; for what avails\nValour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain\nWhich all subdues, and makes remiss the hands\nOf mightiest?  Sense of pleasure we may well\nSpare out of life perhaps, and not repine,\nBut live content, which is the calmest life:\nBut pain is perfect misery, the worst\nOf evils, and, excessive, overturns\nAll patience.  He, who therefore can invent\nWith what more forcible we may offend\nOur yet unwounded enemies, or arm\nOurselves with like defence, to me deserves\nNo less than for deliverance what we owe.\nWhereto with look composed Satan replied.\nNot uninvented that, which thou aright\nBelievest so main to our success, I bring.\nWhich of us who beholds the bright surface\nOf this ethereous mould whereon we stand,\nThis continent of spacious Heaven, adorned\nWith plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems, and gold;\nWhose eye so superficially surveys\nThese things, as not to mind from whence they grow\nDeep under ground, materials dark and crude,\nOf spiritous and fiery spume, till touched\nWith Heaven's ray, and tempered, they shoot forth\nSo beauteous, opening to the ambient light?\nThese in their dark nativity the deep\nShall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame;\nWhich, into hollow engines, long and round,\nThick rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire\nDilated and infuriate, shall send forth\nFrom far, with thundering noise, among our foes\nSuch implements of mischief, as shall dash\nTo pieces, and o'erwhelm whatever stands\nAdverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed\nThe Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.\nNor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn,\nEffect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive;\nAbandon fear; to strength and counsel joined\nThink nothing hard, much less to be despaired.\nHe ended, and his words their drooping cheer\nEnlightened, and their languished hope revived.\nThe invention all admired, and each, how he\nTo be the inventer missed; so easy it seemed\nOnce found, which yet unfound most would have thought\nImpossible:  Yet, haply, of thy race\nIn future days, if malice should abound,\nSome one intent on mischief, or inspired\nWith devilish machination, might devise\nLike instrument to plague the sons of men\nFor sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.\nForthwith from council to the work they flew;\nNone arguing stood; innumerable hands\nWere ready; in a moment up they turned\nWide the celestial soil, and saw beneath\nThe originals of nature in their crude\nConception; sulphurous and nitrous foam\nThey found, they mingled, and, with subtle art,\nConcocted and adusted they reduced\nTo blackest grain, and into store conveyed:\nPart hidden veins digged up (nor hath this earth\nEntrails unlike) of mineral and stone,\nWhereof to found their engines and their balls\nOf missive ruin; part incentive reed\nProvide, pernicious with one touch to fire.\nSo all ere day-spring, under conscious night,\nSecret they finished, and in order set,\nWith silent circumspection, unespied.\nNow when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared,\nUp rose the victor-Angels, and to arms\nThe matin trumpet sung:  In arms they stood\nOf golden panoply, refulgent host,\nSoon banded; others from the dawning hills\nLook round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour,\nEach quarter to descry the distant foe,\nWhere lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,\nIn motion or in halt:  Him soon they met\nUnder spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow\nBut firm battalion; back with speediest sail\nZophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,\nCame flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried.\nArm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand,\nWhom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit\nThis day; fear not his flight;so thick a cloud\nHe comes, and settled in his face I see\nSad resolution, and secure:  Let each\nHis adamantine coat gird well, and each\nFit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield,\nBorne even or high; for this day will pour down,\nIf I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower,\nBut rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.\nSo warned he them, aware themselves, and soon\nIn order, quit of all impediment;\nInstant without disturb they took alarm,\nAnd onward moved embattled:  When behold!\nNot distant far with heavy pace the foe\nApproaching gross and huge, in hollow cube\nTraining his devilish enginery, impaled\nOn every side with shadowing squadrons deep,\nTo hide the fraud.  At interview both stood\nA while; but suddenly at head appeared\nSatan, and thus was heard commanding loud.\nVanguard, to right and left the front unfold;\nThat all may see who hate us, how we seek\nPeace and composure, and with open breast\nStand ready to receive them, if they like\nOur overture; and turn not back perverse:\nBut that I doubt; however witness, Heaven!\nHeaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge\nFreely our part: ye, who appointed stand\nDo as you have in charge, and briefly touch\nWhat we propound, and loud that all may hear!\nSo scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce\nHad ended; when to right and left the front\nDivided, and to either flank retired:\nWhich to our eyes discovered, new and strange,\nA triple mounted row of pillars laid\nOn wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed,\nOr hollowed bodies made of oak or fir,\nWith branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,)\nBrass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths\nWith hideous orifice gaped on us wide,\nPortending hollow truce:  At each behind\nA Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed\nStood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense,\nCollected stood within our thoughts amused,\nNot long; for sudden all at once their reeds\nPut forth, and to a narrow vent applied\nWith nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,\nBut soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,\nFrom those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar\nEmbowelled with outrageous noise the air,\nAnd all her entrails tore, disgorging foul\nTheir devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail\nOf iron globes; which, on the victor host\nLevelled, with such impetuous fury smote,\nThat, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,\nThough standing else as rocks, but down they fell\nBy thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;\nThe sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might\nHave easily, as Spirits, evaded swift\nBy quick contraction or remove; but now\nFoul dissipation followed, and forced rout;\nNor served it to relax their serried files.\nWhat should they do? if on they rushed, repulse\nRepeated, and indecent overthrow\nDoubled, would render them yet more despised,\nAnd to their foes a laughter; for in view\nStood ranked of Seraphim another row,\nIn posture to displode their second tire\nOf thunder:  Back defeated to return\nThey worse abhorred.  Satan beheld their plight,\nAnd to his mates thus in derision called.\nO Friends! why come not on these victors proud\nEre while they fierce were coming; and when we,\nTo entertain them fair with open front\nAnd breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms\nOf composition, straight they changed their minds,\nFlew off, and into strange vagaries fell,\nAs they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed\nSomewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps\nFor joy of offered peace:  But I suppose,\nIf our proposals once again were heard,\nWe should compel them to a quick result.\nTo whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.\nLeader! the terms we sent were terms of weight,\nOf hard contents, and full of force urged home;\nSuch as we might perceive amused them all,\nAnd stumbled many:  Who receives them right,\nHad need from head to foot well understand;\nNot understood, this gift they have besides,\nThey show us when our foes walk not upright.\nSo they among themselves in pleasant vein\nStood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond\nAll doubt of victory:  Eternal Might\nTo match with their inventions they presumed\nSo easy, and of his thunder made a scorn,\nAnd all his host derided, while they stood\nA while in trouble:  But they stood not long;\nRage prompted them at length, and found them arms\nAgainst such hellish mischief fit to oppose.\nForthwith (behold the excellence, the power,\nWhich God hath in his mighty Angels placed!)\nTheir arms away they threw, and to the hills\n(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven\nOf pleasure situate in hill and dale,)\nLight as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew;\nFrom their foundations loosening to and fro,\nThey plucked the seated hills, with all their load,\nRocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops\nUp-lifting bore them in their hands:  Amaze,\nBe sure, and terrour, seized the rebel host,\nWhen coming towards them so dread they saw\nThe bottom of the mountains upward turned;\nTill on those cursed engines' triple-row\nThey saw them whelmed, and all their confidence\nUnder the weight of mountains buried deep;\nThemselves invaded next, and on their heads\nMain promontories flung, which in the air\nCame shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed;\nTheir armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised\nInto their substance pent, which wrought them pain\nImplacable, and many a dolorous groan;\nLong struggling underneath, ere they could wind\nOut of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,\nPurest at first, now gross by sinning grown.\nThe rest, in imitation, to like arms\nBetook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore:\nSo hills amid the air encountered hills,\nHurled to and fro with jaculation dire;\nThat under ground they fought in dismal shade;\nInfernal noise! war seemed a civil game\nTo this uproar; horrid confusion heaped\nUpon confusion rose:  And now all Heaven\nHad gone to wrack, with ruin overspread;\nHad not the Almighty Father, where he sits\nShrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure,\nConsulting on the sum of things, foreseen\nThis tumult, and permitted all, advised:\nThat his great purpose he might so fulfil,\nTo honour his anointed Son avenged\nUpon his enemies, and to declare\nAll power on him transferred:  Whence to his Son,\nThe Assessour of his throne, he thus began.\nEffulgence of my glory, Son beloved,\nSon, in whose face invisible is beheld\nVisibly, what by Deity I am;\nAnd in whose hand what by decree I do,\nSecond Omnipotence! two days are past,\nTwo days, as we compute the days of Heaven,\nSince Michael and his Powers went forth to tame\nThese disobedient:  Sore hath been their fight,\nAs likeliest was, when two such foes met armed;\nFor to themselves I left them; and thou knowest,\nEqual in their creation they were formed,\nSave what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought\nInsensibly, for I suspend their doom;\nWhence in perpetual fight they needs must last\nEndless, and no solution will be found:\nWar wearied hath performed what war can do,\nAnd to disordered rage let loose the reins\nWith mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes\nWild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.\nTwo days are therefore past, the third is thine;\nFor thee I have ordained it; and thus far\nHave suffered, that the glory may be thine\nOf ending this great war, since none but Thou\nCan end it.  Into thee such virtue and grace\nImmense I have transfused, that all may know\nIn Heaven and Hell thy power above compare;\nAnd, this perverse commotion governed thus,\nTo manifest thee worthiest to be Heir\nOf all things; to be Heir, and to be King\nBy sacred unction, thy deserved right.\nGo then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might;\nAscend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels\nThat shake Heaven's basis, bring forth all my war,\nMy bow and thunder, my almighty arms\nGird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh;\nPursue these sons of darkness, drive them out\nFrom all Heaven's bounds into the utter deep:\nThere let them learn, as likes them, to despise\nGod, and Messiah his anointed King.\nHe said, and on his Son with rays direct\nShone full; he all his Father full expressed\nIneffably into his face received;\nAnd thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.\nO Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones,\nFirst, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek'st\nTo glorify thy Son, I always thee,\nAs is most just:  This I my glory account,\nMy exaltation, and my whole delight,\nThat thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will\nFulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.\nScepter and power, thy giving, I assume,\nAnd gladlier shall resign, when in the end\nThou shalt be all in all, and I in thee\nFor ever; and in me all whom thou lovest:\nBut whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on\nThy terrours, as I put thy mildness on,\nImage of thee in all things; and shall soon,\nArmed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled;\nTo their prepared ill mansion driven down,\nTo chains of darkness, and the undying worm;\nThat from thy just obedience could revolt,\nWhom to obey is happiness entire.\nThen shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure\nFar separate, circling thy holy mount,\nUnfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,\nHymns of high praise, and I among them Chief.\nSo said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose\nFrom the right hand of Glory where he sat;\nAnd the third sacred morn began to shine,\nDawning through Heaven.  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound\nThe chariot of Paternal Deity,\nFlashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn,\nItself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed\nBy four Cherubick shapes; four faces each\nHad wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all\nAnd wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels\nOf beryl, and careering fires between;\nOver their heads a crystal firmament,\nWhereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure\nAmber, and colours of the showery arch.\nHe, in celestial panoply all armed\nOf radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,\nAscended; at his right hand Victory\nSat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow\nAnd quiver with three-bolted thunder stored;\nAnd from about him fierce effusion rolled\nOf smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire:\nAttended with ten thousand thousand Saints,\nHe onward came; far off his coming shone;\nAnd twenty thousand (I their number heard)\nChariots of God, half on each hand, were seen;\nHe on the wings of Cherub rode sublime\nOn the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned,\nIllustrious far and wide; but by his own\nFirst seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised,\nWhen the great ensign of Messiah blazed\nAloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven;\nUnder whose conduct Michael soon reduced\nHis army, circumfused on either wing,\nUnder their Head imbodied all in one.\nBefore him Power Divine his way prepared;\nAt his command the uprooted hills retired\nEach to his place; they heard his voice, and went\nObsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed,\nAnd with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.\nThis saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured,\nAnd to rebellious fight rallied their Powers,\nInsensate, hope conceiving from despair.\nIn heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?\nBut to convince the proud what signs avail,\nOr wonders move the obdurate to relent?\nThey, hardened more by what might most reclaim,\nGrieving to see his glory, at the sight\nTook envy; and, aspiring to his highth,\nStood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud\nWeening to prosper, and at length prevail\nAgainst God and Messiah, or to fall\nIn universal ruin last; and now\nTo final battle drew, disdaining flight,\nOr faint retreat; when the great Son of God\nTo all his host on either hand thus spake.\nStand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand,\nYe Angels armed; this day from battle rest:\nFaithful hath been your warfare, and of God\nAccepted, fearless in his righteous cause;\nAnd as ye have received, so have ye done,\nInvincibly:  But of this cursed crew\nThe punishment to other hand belongs;\nVengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints:\nNumber to this day's work is not ordained,\nNor multitude; stand only, and behold\nGod's indignation on these godless poured\nBy me; not you, but me, they have despised,\nYet envied; against me is all their rage,\nBecause the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme\nKingdom, and power, and glory appertains,\nHath honoured me, according to his will.\nTherefore to me their doom he hath assigned;\nThat they may have their wish, to try with me\nIn battle which the stronger proves; they all,\nOr I alone against them; since by strength\nThey measure all, of other excellence\nNot emulous, nor care who them excels;\nNor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.\nSo spake the Son, and into terrour changed\nHis countenance too severe to be beheld,\nAnd full of wrath bent on his enemies.\nAt once the Four spread out their starry wings\nWith dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs\nOf his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound\nOf torrent floods, or of a numerous host.\nHe on his impious foes right onward drove,\nGloomy as night; under his burning wheels\nThe stedfast empyrean shook throughout,\nAll but the throne itself of God.  Full soon\nAmong them he arrived; in his right hand\nGrasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent\nBefore him, such as in their souls infixed\nPlagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost,\nAll courage; down their idle weapons dropt:\nO'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode\nOf Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,\nThat wished the mountains now might be again\nThrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.\nNor less on either side tempestuous fell\nHis arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four\nDistinct with eyes, and from the living wheels\nDistinct alike with multitude of eyes;\nOne Spirit in them ruled; and every eye\nGlared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire\nAmong the accursed, that withered all their strength,\nAnd of their wonted vigour left them drained,\nExhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.\nYet half his strength he put not forth, but checked\nHis thunder in mid volley; for he meant\nNot to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:\nThe overthrown he raised, and as a herd\nOf goats or timorous flock together thronged\nDrove them before him thunder-struck, pursued\nWith terrours, and with furies, to the bounds\nAnd crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,\nRolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed\nInto the wasteful deep:  The monstrous sight\nStruck them with horrour backward, but far worse\nUrged them behind:  Headlong themselves they threw\nDown from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath\nBurnt after them to the bottomless pit.\nHell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw\nHeaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled\nAffrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep\nHer dark foundations, and too fast had bound.\nNine days they fell:  Confounded Chaos roared,\nAnd felt tenfold confusion in their fall\nThrough his wild anarchy, so huge a rout\nIncumbered him with ruin:  Hell at last\nYawning received them whole, and on them closed;\nHell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire\nUnquenchable, the house of woe and pain.\nDisburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired\nHer mural breach, returning whence it rolled.\nSole victor, from the expulsion of his foes,\nMessiah his triumphal chariot turned:\nTo meet him all his Saints, who silent stood\nEye-witnesses of his almighty acts,\nWith jubilee advanced; and, as they went,\nShaded with branching palm, each Order bright,\nSung triumph, and him sung victorious King,\nSon, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given,\nWorthiest to reign:  He, celebrated, rode\nTriumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts\nAnd temple of his Mighty Father throned\nOn high; who into glory him received,\nWhere now he sits at the right hand of bliss.\nThus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth,\nAt thy request, and that thou mayest beware\nBy what is past, to thee I have revealed\nWhat might have else to human race been hid;\nThe discord which befel, and war in Heaven\nAmong the angelick Powers, and the deep fall\nOf those too high aspiring, who rebelled\nWith Satan; he who envies now thy state,\nWho now is plotting how he may seduce\nThee also from obedience, that, with him\nBereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake\nHis punishment, eternal misery;\nWhich would be all his solace and revenge,\nAs a despite done against the Most High,\nThee once to gain companion of his woe.\nBut listen not to his temptations, warn\nThy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard,\nBy terrible example, the reward\nOf disobedience; firm they might have stood,\nYet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.","title":"Paradise Lost: Book 06"},{"lines":"Of that sort of Dramatic Poem which is call'd Tragedy.\n\n\nTRAGEDY, as it was antiently compos'd, hath been ever held the\ngravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other Poems:\ntherefore said by Aristotle to be of power by raising pity and fear,\nor terror, to purge the mind of those and such like passions, that is\nto temper and reduce them to just measure with a kind of delight,\nstirr'd up by reading or seeing those passions well imitated. Nor is\nNature wanting in her own effects to make good his assertion: for\nso in Physic things of melancholic hue and quality are us'd against\nmelancholy, sowr against sowr, salt to remove salt humours.\nHence Philosophers and other gravest Writers, as Cicero, Plutarch\nand others, frequently cite out of Tragic Poets, both to adorn and\nillustrate thir discourse.  The Apostle Paul himself thought it not\nunworthy to insert a verse of Euripides into the Text of Holy\nScripture, I Cor. 15. 33. and Paraeus commenting on the\nRevelation, divides the whole Book as a Tragedy, into Acts\ndistinguisht each by a Chorus of Heavenly Harpings and Song\nbetween.  Heretofore Men in highest dignity have labour'd not a\nlittle to be thought able to compose a Tragedy.  Of that honour\nDionysius the elder was no less ambitious, then before of his\nattaining to the Tyranny. Augustus Caesar also had begun his\nAjax, but unable to please his own judgment with what he had\nbegun. left it unfinisht.  Seneca the Philosopher is by some thought\nthe Author of those Tragedies (at lest the best of them) that go\nunder that name.  Gregory Nazianzen a Father of the Church,\nthought it not unbeseeming the sanctity of his person to write a\nTragedy which he entitl'd, Christ suffering. This is mention'd to\nvindicate Tragedy from the small esteem, or rather infamy, which\nin the account of many it undergoes at this day with other common\nInterludes; hap'ning through the Poets error of intermixing Comic\nstuff with Tragic sadness and gravity; or introducing trivial and\nvulgar persons, which by all judicious hath bin counted absurd; and\nbrought in without discretion, corruptly to gratifie the people. And\nthough antient Tragedy use no Prologue, yet using sometimes, in\ncase of self defence, or explanation, that which Martial calls an\nEpistle; in behalf of this Tragedy coming forth after the antient\nmanner, much different from what among us passes for best, thus\nmuch before-hand may be Epistl'd; that Chorus is here introduc'd\nafter the Greek manner, not antient only but modern, and still in\nuse among the Italians. In the modelling therefore of this Poem\nwith good reason, the Antients and Italians are rather follow'd, as\nof much more authority and fame. The measure of Verse us'd in\nthe Chorus is of all sorts, call'd by the Greeks Monostrophic, or\nrather Apolelymenon, without regard had to Strophe, Antistrophe\nor Epod, which were a kind of Stanza's fram'd only for the Music,\nthen us'd with the Chorus that sung; not essential to the Poem, and\ntherefore not material; or being divided into Stanza's or Pauses\nthey may be call'd Allaeostropha.  Division into Act and Scene\nreferring chiefly to the Stage (to which this work never was\nintended) is here omitted.\n\n It suffices if the whole Drama be found not produc't beyond the\nfift Act, of the style and uniformitie, and that commonly call'd the\nPlot, whether intricate or explicit, which is nothing indeed but such\noeconomy, or disposition of the fable as may stand best with\nverisimilitude and decorum; they only will best judge who are not\nunacquainted with Aeschulus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the three\nTragic Poets unequall'd yet by any, and the best rule to all who\nendeavour to write Tragedy. The circumscription of time wherein\nthe whole Drama begins and ends, is according to antient rule, and\nbest example, within the space of 24 hours.\n\n\n\nThe ARGUMENT.\n\n\nSamson made Captive, Blind, and now in the Prison at Gaza, there\nto labour as in a common work-house, on a Festival day, in the\ngeneral cessation from labour, comes forth into the open Air, to a\nplace nigh, somewhat retir'd there to sit a while and bemoan his\ncondition. Where he happens at length to be visited by certain\nfriends and equals of his tribe, which make the Chorus, who seek\nto comfort him what they can ; then by his old Father Manoa, who\nendeavours the like, and withal tells him his purpose to procure his\nliberty by ransom; lastly, that this Feast was proclaim'd by the\nPhilistins as a day of Thanksgiving for thir deliverance from the\nhands of Samson, which yet more troubles him.  Manoa then\ndeparts to prosecute his endeavour with the Philistian Lords for\nSamson's redemption; who in the mean while is visited by other\npersons; and lastly by a publick Officer to require coming to the\nFeast before the Lords and People, to play or shew his strength in\nthir presence; he at first refuses, dismissing the publick officer with\nabsolute denyal to come; at length perswaded inwardly that this\nwas from God, he yields to go along with him, who came now the\nsecond time with great threatnings to fetch him; the Chorus yet\nremaining on the place, Manoa returns full of joyful hope, to\nprocure e're long his Sons deliverance: in the midst of which\ndiscourse an Ebrew comes in haste confusedly at first; and\nafterward more distinctly relating the Catastrophe, what Samson\nhad done to the Philistins, and by accident to himself; wherewith\nthe Tragedy ends.\n\n\nThe Persons\n\nSamson.\nManoa the father of Samson.\nDalila his wife.\nHarapha of Gath.\nPublick Officer.\nMessenger.\nChorus of Danites\n\n\nThe Scene before the Prison in Gaza.\n\nSam:  A little onward lend thy guiding hand\nTo these dark steps, a little further on;\nFor yonder bank hath choice of Sun or shade,\nThere I am wont to sit, when any chance\nRelieves me from my task of servile toyl,\nDaily in the common Prison else enjoyn'd me,\nWhere I a Prisoner chain'd, scarce freely draw\nThe air imprison'd also, close and damp,\nUnwholsom draught: but here I feel amends,\nThe breath of Heav'n fresh-blowing, pure and sweet,\nWith day-spring born; here leave me to respire.\nThis day a solemn Feast the people hold\nTo Dagon thir Sea-Idol, and forbid\nLaborious works, unwillingly this rest\nThir Superstition yields me; hence with leave\nRetiring from the popular noise, I seek\nThis unfrequented place to find some ease,\nEase to the body some, none to the mind\nFrom restless thoughts, that like a deadly swarm\nOf Hornets arm'd, no sooner found alone,\nBut rush upon me thronging, and present\nTimes past, what once I was, and what am now.\nO wherefore was my birth from Heaven foretold\nTwice by an Angel, who at last in sight\nOf both my Parents all in flames ascended\nFrom off the Altar, where an Off'ring burn'd,\nAs in a fiery column charioting\nHis Godlike presence, and from some great act\nOr benefit reveal'd to Abraham's race?\nWhy was my breeding order'd and prescrib'd\nAs of a person separate to God,\nDesign'd for great exploits; if I must dye\nBetray'd, Captiv'd, and both my Eyes put out,\nMade of my Enemies the scorn and gaze;\nTo grind in Brazen Fetters under task\nWith this Heav'n-gifted strength? O glorious strength\nPut to the labour of a Beast, debas't\nLower then bondslave! Promise was that I\nShould Israel from Philistian yoke deliver;\nAsk for this great Deliverer now, and find him\nEyeless in Gaza at the Mill with slaves,\nHimself in bonds under Philistian yoke;\nYet stay, let me not rashly call in doubt\nDivine Prediction; what if all foretold\nHad been fulfilld but through mine own default,\nWhom have I to complain of but my self?\nWho this high gift of strength committed to me,\nIn what part lodg'd, how easily bereft me,\nUnder the Seal of silence could not keep,\nBut weakly to a woman must reveal it\nO'recome with importunity and tears.\nO impotence of mind, in body strong!\nBut what is strength without a double share\nOf wisdom, vast, unwieldy, burdensom,\nProudly secure, yet liable to fall\nBy weakest suttleties, not made to rule,\nBut to subserve where wisdom bears command.\nGod, when he gave me strength, to shew withal\nHow slight the gift was, hung it in my Hair.\nBut peace, I must not quarrel with the will\nOf highest dispensation, which herein\nHapp'ly had ends above my reach to know:\nSuffices that to me strength is my bane,\nAnd proves the sourse of all my miseries;\nSo many, and so huge, that each apart\nWould ask a life to wail, but chief of all,\nO loss of sight, of thee I most complain!\nBlind among enemies, O worse then chains,\nDungeon, or beggery, or decrepit age!\nLight the prime work of God to me is extinct,\nAnd all her various objects of delight\nAnnull'd, which might in part my grief have eas'd,\nInferiour to the vilest now become\nOf man or worm; the vilest here excel me,\nThey creep, yet see, I dark in light expos'd\nTo daily fraud, contempt, abuse and wrong,\nWithin doors, or without, still as a fool,\nIn power of others, never in my own;\nScarce half I seem to live, dead more then half.\nO dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,\nIrrecoverably dark, total Eclipse\nWithout all hope of day!\nO first created Beam, and thou great Word,\nLet there be light, and light was over all;\nWhy am I thus bereav'd thy prime decree?\nThe Sun to me is dark\nAnd silent as the Moon,\nWhen she deserts the night\nHid in her vacant interlunar cave.\nSince light so necessary is to life,\nAnd almost life itself, if it be true\nThat light is in the Soul,\nShe all in every part; why was the sight\nTo such a tender ball as th' eye confin'd?\nSo obvious and so easie to be quench't,\nAnd not as feeling through all parts diffus'd,\nThat she might look at will through every pore?\nThen had I not been thus exil'd from light;\nAs in the land of darkness yet in light,\nTo live a life half dead, a living death,\nAnd buried; but O yet more miserable!\nMy self, my Sepulcher, a moving Grave,\nBuried, yet not exempt\nBy priviledge of death and burial\nFrom worst of other evils, pains and wrongs,\nBut made hereby obnoxious more\nTo all the miseries of life,\nLife in captivity\nAmong inhuman foes.\nBut who are these? for with joint pace I hear\nThe tread of many feet stearing this way;\nPerhaps my enemies who come to stare\nAt my affliction, and perhaps to insult,\nThir daily practice to afflict me more.\n\nChor:  This, this is he; softly a while,\nLet us not break in upon him;\nO change beyond report, thought, or belief!\nSee how he lies at random, carelessly diffus'd,\nWith languish't head unpropt,\nAs one past hope, abandon'd\nAnd by himself given over;\nIn slavish habit, ill-fitted weeds\nO're worn and soild;\nOr do my eyes misrepresent?  Can this be hee,\nThat Heroic, that Renown'd,\nIrresistible Samson? whom unarm'd\nNo strength of man, or fiercest wild beast could withstand;\nWho tore the Lion, as the Lion tears the Kid,\nRan on embattelld Armies clad in Iron,\nAnd weaponless himself,\nMade Arms ridiculous, useless the forgery\nOf brazen shield and spear, the hammer'd Cuirass,\nChalybean temper'd steel, and frock of mail\nAdamantean Proof;\nBut safest he who stood aloof,\nWhen insupportably his foot advanc't,\nIn scorn of thir proud arms and warlike tools,\nSpurn'd them to death by Troops.  The bold Ascalonite\nFled from his Lion ramp, old Warriors turn'd\nThir plated backs under his heel;\nOr grovling soild thir crested helmets in the dust.\nThen with what trivial weapon came to Hand,\nThe Jaw of a dead Ass, his sword of bone,\nA thousand fore-skins fell, the flower of Palestin\nIn Ramath-lechi famous to this day:\nThen by main force pull'd up, and on his shoulders bore\nThe Gates of Azza, Post, and massie Bar\nUp to the Hill by Hebron, seat of Giants old,\nNo journey of a Sabbath day, and loaded so;\nLike whom the Gentiles feign to bear up Heav'n.\nWhich shall I first bewail,\nThy Bondage or lost Sight,\nPrison within Prison\nInseparably dark?\nThou art become (O worst imprisonment!)\nThe Dungeon of thy self; thy Soul\n (Which Men enjoying sight oft without cause complain)\nImprison'd now indeed,\nIn real darkness of the body dwells,\nShut up from outward light\nTo incorporate with gloomy night;\nFor inward light alas\nPuts forth no visual beam.\nO mirror of our fickle state,\nSince man on earth unparallel'd!\nThe rarer thy example stands,\nBy how much from the top of wondrous glory,\nStrongest of mortal men,\nTo lowest pitch of abject fortune thou art fall'n.\nFor him I reckon not in high estate\nWhom long descent of birth\nOr the sphear of fortune raises;\nBut thee whose strength, while vertue was her mate\nMight have subdu'd the Earth,\nUniversally crown'd with highest praises.\n\nSam:  I hear the sound of words, thir sense the air\nDissolves unjointed e're it reach my ear.\n\nChor:  Hee speaks, let us draw nigh.  Matchless in might,\nThe glory late of Israel, now the grief;\nWe come thy friends and neighbours not unknown\nFrom Eshtaol and Zora's fruitful Vale\nTo visit or bewail thee, or if better,\nCounsel or Consolation we may bring,\nSalve to thy Sores, apt words have power to swage\nThe tumors of a troubl'd mind,\nAnd are as Balm to fester'd wounds.\n\nSam:  Your coming, Friends, revives me, for I learn\nNow of my own experience, not by talk,\nHow counterfeit a coin they are who friends\nBear in their Superscription (of the most\nI would be understood) in prosperous days\nThey swarm, but in adverse withdraw their head\nNot to be found, though sought.  Wee see, O friends.\nHow many evils have enclos'd me round;\nYet that which was the worst now least afflicts me,\nBlindness, for had I sight, confus'd with shame,\nHow could I once look up, or heave the head,\nWho like a foolish Pilot have shipwrack't,\nMy Vessel trusted to me from above,\nGloriously rigg'd; and for a word, a tear,\nFool, have divulg'd the secret gift of God\nTo a deceitful Woman : tell me Friends,\nAm I not sung and proverbd for a Fool\nIn every street, do they not say, how well\nAre come upon him his deserts? yet why?\nImmeasurable strength they might behold\nIn me, of wisdom nothing more then mean;\nThis with the other should, at least, have paird,\nThese two proportiond ill drove me transverse.\n\nChor:  Tax not divine disposal, wisest Men\nHave err'd, and by bad Women been deceiv'd;\nAnd shall again, pretend they ne're so wise.\nDeject not then so overmuch thy self,\nWho hast of sorrow thy full load besides;\nYet truth to say, I oft have heard men wonder\nWhy thou shouldst wed Philistian women rather\nThen of thine own Tribe fairer, or as fair,\nAt least of thy own Nation, and as noble.\n\nSam:  The first I saw at Timna, and she pleas'd\nMee, not my Parents, that I sought to wed,\nThe daughter of an Infidel: they knew not\nThat what I motion'd was of God; I knew\nFrom intimate impulse, and therefore urg'd\nThe Marriage on; that by occasion hence\nI might begin Israel's Deliverance,\nThe work to which I was divinely call'd;\nShe proving false, the next I took to Wife\n(O that I never had! fond wish too late)\nWas in the Vale of Sorec, Dalila,\nThat specious Monster, my accomplisht snare.\nI thought it lawful from my former act,\nAnd the same end; still watching to oppress\nIsrael's oppressours: of what now I suffer\nShe was not the prime cause, but I my self,\nWho vanquisht with a peal of words (O weakness!)\nGave up my fort of silence to a Woman.\n\nChor:  In seeking just occasion to provoke\nThe Philistine, thy Countries Enemy,\nThou never wast remiss, I hear thee witness:\nYet Israel still serves with all his Sons.\n\nSam:  That fault I take not on me, but transfer\nOn Israel's Governours, and Heads of Tribes,\nWho seeing those great acts which God had done\nSingly by me against their Conquerours\nAcknowledg'd not, or not at all consider'd\nDeliverance offerd : I on th' other side\nUs'd no ambition to commend my deeds,\nThe deeds themselves, though mute, spoke loud the dooer;\nBut they persisted deaf, and would not seem\nTo count them things worth notice, till at length\nThir Lords the Philistines with gather'd powers\nEnterd Judea seeking mee, who then\nSafe to the rock of Etham was retir'd,\nNot flying, but fore-casting in what place\nTo set upon them, what advantag'd best;\nMean while the men of Judah to prevent\nThe harrass of thir Land, beset me round;\nI willingly on some conditions came\nInto thir hands, and they as gladly yield me\nTo the uncircumcis'd a welcom prey,\nBound with two cords; but cords to me were threds\nToucht with the flame: on thir whole Host I flew\nUnarm'd, and with a trivial weapon fell'd\nThir choicest youth; they only liv'd who fled.\nHad Judah that day join'd, or one whole Tribe,\nThey had by this possess'd the Towers of Gath,\nAnd lorded over them whom now they serve;\nBut what more oft in Nations grown corrupt,\nAnd by thir vices brought to servitude,\nThen to love Bondage more then Liberty,\nBondage with ease then strenuous liberty;\nAnd to despise, or envy, or suspect\nWhom God hath of his special favour rais'd\nAs thir Deliverer; if he aught begin,\nHow frequent to desert him, and at last\nTo heap ingratitude on worthiest deeds?\n\nChor:  Thy words to my remembrance bring\nHow Succoth and the Fort of Penuel\nThir great Deliverer contemn'd,\nThe matchless Gideon in pursuit\nOf Madian and her vanquisht Kings;\nAnd how ingrateful Ephraim\nNot worse then by his shield and spear\nHad dealt with Jephtha, who by argument,\nDefended Israel from the Ammonite,\nHad not his prowess quell'd thir pride\nIn that sore battel when so many dy'd\nWithout Reprieve adjudg'd to death,\nFor want of well pronouncing Shibboleth.\n\nSam:  Of such examples adde mee to the roul,\nMee easily indeed mine may neglect,\nBut Gods propos'd deliverance not so.\n\nChor: Just are the ways of God,\nAnd justifiable to Men;\nUnless there be who think not God at all,\nIf any be, they walk obscure;\nFor of such Doctrine never was there School,\nBut the heart of the Fool,\nAnd no man therein Doctor but himself.\nYet more there be who doubt his ways not just,\nAs to his own edicts, found contradicting,\nThen give the rains to wandring thought,\nRegardless of his glories diminution;\nTill by thir own perplexities involv'd\nThey ravel more, still less resolv'd,\nBut never find self-satisfying solution.\nAs if they would confine th' interminable,\nAnd tie him to his own prescript,\nWho made our Laws to bind us, not himself,\nAnd hath full right to exempt\nWhom so it pleases him by choice\nFrom National obstriction, without taint\nOf sin, or legal debt;\nFor with his own Laws he can best dispence.\nHe would not else who never wanted means,\nNor in respect of the enemy just cause\nTo set his people free,\nHave prompted this Heroic Nazarite,\nAgainst his vow of strictest purity,\nTo seek in marriage that fallacious Bride,\nUnclean, unchaste.\nDown Reason then, at least vain reasonings down,\nThough Reason here aver\nThat moral verdit quits her of unclean :\nUnchaste was subsequent, her stain not his.\nBut see here comes thy reverend Sire\nWith careful step, Locks white as doune,\nOld Manoah: advise\nForthwith how thou oughtst to receive him.\n\nSam:  Ay me, another inward grief awak't,\nWith mention of that name renews th' assault.\n\nMan:  Brethren and men of Dan, for such ye seem,\nThough in this uncouth place; if old respect,\nAs I suppose, towards your once gloried friend,\nMy Son now Captive, hither hath inform'd\nYour younger feet, while mine cast back with age\nCame lagging after; say if he be here.\n\nChor:  As signal now in low dejected state,\nAs earst in highest; behold him where be lies.\n\nMan:  O miserable change! is this the man,\nThat invincible Samson, far renown'd,\nThe dread of Israel's foes, who with a strength\nEquivalent to Angels walk'd thir streets,\nNone offering fight; who single combatant\nDuell'd thir Armies rank't in proud array,\nHimself an Army, now unequal match\nTo save himself against a coward arm'd\nAt one spears length.  O ever failing trust\nIn mortal strength! and oh what not in man\nDeceivable and vain! Nay what thing good\nPray'd for, but often proves our woe, our bane?\nI pray'd for Children, and thought barrenness\nIn wedlock a reproach; I gain'd a Son,\nAnd such a Son as all Men hail'd me happy;\nWho would be now a Father in my stead?\nO wherefore did God grant me my request,\nAnd as a blessing with such pomp adorn'd?\nWhy are his gifts desirable, to tempt\nOur earnest Prayers, then giv'n with solemn hand\nAs Graces, draw a Scorpions tail behind?\nFor this did the Angel twice descend? for this\nOrdain'd thy nurture holy, as of a Plant;\nSelect, and Sacred, Glorious for a while,\nThe miracle of men: then in an hour\nEnsnar'd, assaulted, overcome, led bound,\nThy Foes derision, Captive, Poor, and Blind\nInto a Dungeon thrust, to work with Slaves?\nAlas methinks whom God hath chosen once\nTo worthiest deeds, if he through frailty err,\nHe should not so o'rewhelm, and as a thrall\nSubject him to so foul indignities,\nBe it but for honours sake of former deeds.\n\nSam:  Appoint not heavenly disposition, Father,\nNothing of all these evils hath befall'n me\nBut justly; I my self have brought them on,\nSole Author I, sole cause: if aught seem vile,\nAs vile hath been my folly, who have profan'd\nThe mystery of God giv'n me under pledge\nOf vow, and have betray'd it to a woman,\nA Canaanite, my faithless enemy.\nThis well I knew, nor was at all surpris'd,\nBut warn'd by oft experience: did not she\nOf Timna first betray me, and reveal\nThe secret wrested from me in her highth\nOf Nuptial Love profest, carrying it strait\nTo them who had corrupted her, my Spies,\nAnd Rivals? In this other was there found\nMore Faith? who also in her prime of love,\nSpousal embraces, vitiated with Gold,\nThough offer'd only, by the sent conceiv'd\nHer spurious first-born; Treason against me?\nThrice she assay'd with flattering prayers and sighs,\nAnd amorous reproaches to win from me\nMy capital secret, in what part my strength\nLay stor'd in what part summ'd, that she might know:\nThrice I deluded her, and turn'd to sport\nHer importunity, each time perceiving\nHow openly, and with what impudence\nShe purpos'd to betray me, and (which was worse\nThen undissembl'd hate) with what contempt\nShe sought to make me Traytor to my self;\nYet the fourth time, when mustring all her wiles,\nWith blandisht parlies, feminine assaults,\nTongue-batteries, she surceas'd not day nor night\nTo storm me over-watch't, and wearied out.\nAt times when men seek most repose and rest,\nI yielded, and unlock'd her all my heart,\nWho with a grain of manhood well resolv'd\nMight easily have shook off all her snares :\nBut foul effeminacy held me yok't\nHer Bond-slave; O indignity, O blot\nTo Honour and Religion! servil mind\nRewarded well with servil punishment!\nThe base degree to which I now am fall'n,\nThese rags, this grinding, is not yet so base\nAs was my former servitude, ignoble,\nUnmanly, ignominious, infamous,\nTrue slavery, and that blindness worse then this,\nThat saw not how degeneratly I serv'd.\n\nMan:  I cannot praise thy Marriage choises, Son,\nRather approv'd them not; but thou didst plead\nDivine impulsion prompting how thou might'st\nFind some occasion to infest our Foes.\nI state not that; this I am sure; our Foes\nFound soon occasion thereby to make thee\nThir Captive, and thir triumph; thou the sooner\nTemptation found'st, or over-potent charms\nTo violate the sacred trust of silence\nDeposited within thee; which to have kept\nTacit, was in thy power; true; and thou hear'st\nEnough, and more the burden of that fault;\nBitterly hast thou paid, and still art paying\nThat rigid score.  A worse thing yet remains,\nThis day the Philistines a popular Feast\nHere celebrate in Gaza, and proclaim\nGreat Pomp, and Sacrifice, and Praises loud\nTo Dagon, as their God who hath deliver'd\nThee Samson bound and blind into thir hands,\nThem out of thine, who slew'st them many a slain.\nSo Dagon shall be magnifi'd, and God,\nBesides whom is no God, compar'd with Idols,\nDisglorifi'd, blasphem'd, and had in scorn\nBy th' Idolatrous rout amidst thir wine;\nWhich to have come to pass by means of thee,\nSamson, of all thy sufferings think the heaviest,\nOf all reproach the most with shame that ever\nCould have befall'n thee and thy Fathers house.\n\nSam:  Father, I do acknowledge and confess\nThat I this honour, I this pomp have brought\nTo Dagon, and advanc'd his praises high\nAmong the Heathen round; to God have brought\nDishonour, obloquie, and op't the mouths\nOf Idolists, and Atheists; have brought scandal\nTo Israel diffidence of God, and doubt\nIn feeble hearts, propense anough before\nTo waver, or fall off and joyn with Idols:\nWhich is my chief affliction, shame and sorrow,\nThe anguish of my Soul, that suffers not\nMine eie to harbour sleep, or thoughts to rest.\nThis only hope relieves me, that the strife\nWith me hath end; all the contest is now\n'Twixt God and Dagon; Dagon hath presum'd,\nMe overthrown, to enter lists with God,\nHis Deity comparing and preferring\nBefore the God of Abraham. He, he sure,\nWill not connive, or linger, thus provok'd,\nBut will arise and his great name assert:\nDagon must stoop, and shall e're long receive\nSuch a discomfit, as shall quite despoil him\nOf all these boasted Trophies won on me,\nAnd with confusion blank his Worshippers.\n\nMan: With cause this hope relieves thee, and these words\nI as a Prophecy receive: for God,\nNothing more certain, will not long defer\nTo vindicate the glory of his name\nAgainst all competition, nor will long\nEndure it, doubtful whether God be Lord,\nOr Dagon.  But for thee what shall be done?\nThou must not in the mean while here forgot\nLie in this miserable loathsom plight\nNeglected.  I already have made way\nTo some Philistian Lords, with whom to treat\nAbout thy ransom: well they may by this\nHave satisfi'd thir utmost of revenge\nBy pains and slaveries, worse then death inflicted\nOn thee, who now no more canst do them harm.\n\nSam:  Spare that proposal, Father, spare the trouble\nOf that sollicitation; let me here,\nAs I deserve, pay on my punishment;\nAnd expiate, if possible, my crime,\nShameful garrulity.  To have reveal'd\nSecrets of men, the secrets of a friend,\nHow hainous had the fact been, how deserving\nContempt, and scorn of all, to be excluded\nAll friendship, and avoided as a blab,\nThe mark of fool set on his front?\nBut I Gods counsel have not kept, his holy  secret\nPresumptuously have publish'd, impiously,\nWeakly at least, and shamefully: A sin\nThat Gentiles in thir Parables condemn\nTo thir abyss and horrid pains confin'd.\n\nMan:  Be penitent and for thy fault contrite,\nBut act not in thy own affliction, Son,\nRepent the sin, but if the punishment\nThou canst avoid, selfpreservation bids;\nOr th' execution leave to high disposal,\nAnd let another hand, not thine, exact\nThy penal forfeit from thy self; perhaps\nGod will relent, and quit thee all his debt;\nWho evermore approves and more accepts\n(Best pleas'd with humble and filial submission)\nHim who imploring mercy sues for life,\nThen who selfrigorous chooses death as due;\nWhich argues overjust, and self-displeas'd\nFor self-offence, more then for God offended.\nReject not then what offerd means, who knows\nBut God hath set before us, to return thee\nHome to thy countrey and his sacred house,\nWhere thou mayst bring thy off'rings, to avert\nHis further ire, with praiers and vows renew'd.\n\nSam:  His pardon I implore; but as for life,\nTo what end should I seek it? when in strength\nAll mortals I excell'd, and great in hopes\nWith youthful courage and magnanimous thoughts\nOf birth from  Heav'n foretold and high exploits,\nFull of divine instinct, after some proof\nOf acts indeed heroic, far beyond\nThe Sons of Anac, famous now and blaz'd,\nFearless of danger, like a petty God\nI walk'd about admir'd of all and dreaded\nOn hostile ground, none daring my affront.\nThen swoll'n with pride into the snare I fell\nOf fair fallacious looks, venereal trains,\nSoftn'd with pleasure and voluptuous life;\nAt length to lay my head and hallow'd pledge\nOf all my strength in the lascivious lap\nOf a deceitful Concubine who shore me\nLike a tame Weather, all my precious fleece,\nThen turn'd me out ridiculous, despoil'd,\nShav'n, and disarm'd among my enemies.\n\nChor.  Desire of wine and all delicious drinks,\nWhich many a famous Warriour overturns,\nThou couldst repress, nor did the dancing Rubie\nSparkling; out-pow'rd, the flavor, or the smell,\nOr taste that cheers the heart of Gods and men,\nAllure thee from the cool Crystalline stream.\n\nSam. Where ever fountain or fresh current flow'd\nAgainst the Eastern ray, translucent, pure,\nWith touch aetherial of Heav'ns fiery rod\nI drank, from the clear milkie juice allaying\nThirst, and refresht; nor envy'd them the grape\nWhose heads that turbulent liquor fills with fumes.\n\nChor.  O madness, to think use of strongest wines\nAnd strongest drinks our chief support of health,\nWhen God with these forbid'n made choice to rear\nHis mighty Champion, strong above compare,\nWhose drink was only from the liquid brook.\n\n Sam.  But what avail'd this temperance, not compleat\nAgainst another object more enticing?\nWhat boots it at one gate to make defence,\nAnd at another to let in the foe\nEffeminatly vanquish't? by which means,\nNow blind, disheartn'd, sham'd, dishonour'd, quell'd,\nTo what can I be useful, wherein serve\nMy Nation, and the work from Heav'n impos'd,\nBut to sit idle on the houshold hearth,\nA burdenous drone; to visitants a gaze,\nOr pitied object, these redundant locks\nRobustious to no purpose clustring down,\nVain monument of strength; till length of years\nAnd sedentary numness craze my limbs\nTo a contemptible old age obscure.\nHere rather let me drudge and earn my bread,\nTill vermin or the draff of servil food\nConsume me, and oft-invocated death\nHast'n the welcom end of all my pains.\n\nMan.  Wilt thou then serve the Philistines with that gift\nWhich was expresly giv'n thee to annoy them?\nBetter at home lie bed-rid, not only idle,\nInglorious, unimploy'd, with age out-worn.\nBut God who caus'd a fountain at thy prayer\nFrom the dry ground to spring, thy thirst to allay\nAfter the brunt of battel, can as easie\nCause light again within thy eies to spring,\nWherewith to serve him better then thou hast;\nAnd I perswade me so; why else this strength\nMiraculous yet remaining in those locks?\nHis might continues in thee not for naught,\nNor shall his wondrous gifts be frustrate thus.\n\nSam:  All otherwise to me my thoughts portend,\nThat these dark orbs no more shall treat with light,\nNor th' other light of life continue long,\nBut yield to double darkness nigh at hand:\nSo much I feel my genial spirits droop,\nMy hopes all flat, nature within me seems\nIn all her functions weary of herself;\nMy race of glory run, and race of shame,\nAnd I shall shortly be with them that rest.\n\nMan.  Believe not these suggestions which proceed\nFrom anguish of the mind and humours black,\nThat mingle with thy fancy.  I however\nMust not omit a Fathers timely care\nTo prosecute the means of thy deliverance\nBy ransom or how else: mean while be calm,\nAnd healing words from these thy friends admit.\n\nSam.  O that torment should not be confin'd\nTo the bodies wounds and sores\nWith maladies innumerable\nIn heart, head, brest, and reins;\nBut must secret passage find\nTo th' inmost mind,\nThere exercise all his fierce accidents,\nAnd on her purest spirits prey,\nAs on entrails, joints, and limbs,\nWith answerable pains, but more intense,\n'Though void of corporal sense.\nMy griefs not only pain me\nAs a lingring disease,\nBut finding no redress, ferment and rage,\nNor less then wounds immedicable\nRanckle, and fester, and gangrene,\nTo black mortification.\nThoughts my Tormenters arm'd with deadly stings\nMangle my apprehensive tenderest parts,\nExasperate, exulcerate, and raise\nDire inflammation which no cooling herb\nOr rnedcinal liquor can asswage,\nNor breath of Vernal Air from snowy Alp.\nSleep hath forsook and giv'n me o're\nTo deaths benumming Opium as my only cure.\nThence faintings, swounings of despair,\nAnd sense of Heav'ns desertion.\nI was his nursling once and choice delight,\nHis destin'd from the womb,\nPromisd by Heavenly message twice descending.\nUnder his special eie\nAbstemious I grew up and thriv'd amain;\nHe led me on to mightiest deeds\nAbove the nerve of mortal arm\nAgainst the uncircumcis'd, our enemies.\nBut now hath cast me off as never known,\nAnd to those cruel enemies,\nWhom I by his appointment had provok't,\nLeft me all helpless with th' irreparable loss\nOf sight, reserv'd alive to be repeated\nThe subject of thir cruelty, or scorn.\nNor am I in the list of them that hope;\nHopeless are all my evils, all remediless;\nThis one prayer yet remains, might I be heard,\nNo long petition, speedy death,\nThe close of all my miseries, and the balm.\n\nChor:  Many are the sayings of the wise\nIn antient and in modern books enroll'd;\nExtolling Patience as the truest fortitude;\nAnd to the bearing well of all calamities,\nAll chances incident to mans frail life\nConsolatories writ\nWith studied argument, and much perswasion sought\nLenient of grief and anxious thought,\nBut with th' afflicted in his pangs thir sound\nLittle prevails, or rather seems a tune,\nHarsh, and of dissonant mood from his complaint,\nUnless he feel within\nSome sourse of consolation from above;\nSecret refreshings, that repair his strength,\nAnd fainting spirits uphold.\nGod of our Fathers, what is man!\nThat thou towards him with hand so various,\nOr might I say contrarious,\nTemperst thy providence through his short course,\nNot evenly, as thou rul'st\nThe Angelic orders and inferiour creatures mute,\nIrrational and brute.\nNor do I name of men the common rout,\nThat wandring loose about\nGrow up and perish, as the summer flie,\nHeads without name no more rememberd,\nBut such as thou hast solemnly elected,\nWith gifts and graces eminently adorn'd\nTo some great work, thy glory,\nAnd peoples safety, which in part they effect:\nYet toward these thus dignifi'd, thou oft\nAmidst thir highth of noon,\nChangest thy countenance, and thy hand with no regard\nOf highest favours past\nFrom thee on them, or them to thee of service.\nNor only dost degrade them, or remit\nTo life obscur'd, which were a fair dismission,\nBut throw'st them lower then thou didst exalt them high,\nUnseemly falls in human eie,\nToo grievous for the trespass or omission,\nOft leav'st them to the hostile sword\nOf Heathen and prophane, thir carkasses\nTo dogs and fowls a prey, or else captiv'd:\nOr to the unjust tribunals, under change of times,\nAnd condemnation of the ingrateful multitude.\nIf these they scape, perhaps in poverty\nWith sickness and disease thou bow'st them down,\nPainful diseases and deform'd,\nIn crude old age;\nThough not disordinate, yet causless suffring\nThe punishment of dissolute days, in fine,\nJust or unjust, alike seem miserable,\nFor oft alike, both come to evil end.\nSo deal not with this once thy glorious Champion,\nThe Image of thy strength, and mighty minister.\nWhat do I beg? how hast thou dealt already?\nBehold him in this state calamitous, and turn\nHis labours, for thou canst, to peaceful end.\nBut who is this, what thing of Sea or Land?\nFemal of sex it seems,\nThat so bedeckt, ornate, and gay,\nComes this way sailing\nLike a stately Ship\nOf Tarsus, bound for th' Isles\nOf Javan or Gadier\nWith all her bravery on, and tackle trim,\nSails fill'd, and streamers waving,\nCourted by all the winds that hold them play,\nAn Amber sent of odorous perfume\nHer harbinger, a damsel train behind;\nSome rich Philistian Matron she may seem,\nAnd now at nearer view, no other certain\nThan Dalila thy wife.\n\nSam:  My Wife, my Traytress, let her not come near me.\n\nCho:  Yet on she moves, now stands & eies thee fixt,\nAbout t'have spoke, but now, with head declin'd\nLike a fair flower surcharg'd with dew, she weeps\nAnd words addrest seem into tears dissolv'd,\nWetting the borders of her silk'n veil:\nBut now again she makes address to speak.\n\nDal:  With doubtful feet and wavering resolution\nI came, still dreading thy displeasure, Samson,\nWhich to have merited, without excuse,\nI cannot but acknowledge; yet if tears\nMay expiate (though the fact more evil drew\nIn the perverse event then I foresaw)\nMy penance hath not slack'n'd, though my pardon\nNo way assur'd.  But conjugal affection\nPrevailing over fear, and timerous doubt\nHath led me on desirous to behold\nOnce more thy face, and know of thy estate.\nIf aught in my ability may serve\nTo light'n what thou suffer'st, and appease\nThy mind with what amends is in my power,\nThough late, yet in some part to recompense\nMy rash but more unfortunate misdeed.\n\nSam:  Out, out Hyaena; these are thy wonted arts,\nAnd arts of every woman false like thee,\nTo break all faith, all vows, deceive, betray,\nThen as repentant to submit, beseech,\nAnd reconcilement move with feign'd remorse,\nConfess, and promise wonders in her change,\nNot truly penitent, but chief to try\nHer husband, how far urg'd his patience bears,\nHis vertue or weakness which way to assail:\nThen with more cautious and instructed skill\nAgain transgresses, and again submits;\nThat wisest and best men full oft beguil'd\nWith goodness principl'd not to reject\nThe penitent, but ever to forgive,\nAre drawn to wear out miserable days,\nEntangl'd with a poysnous bosom snake,\nIf not by quick destruction soon cut off\nAs I by thee, to Ages an example.\n\nDal: Yet hear me Samson; not that I endeavour\nTo lessen or extenuate my offence,\nBut that on th' other side if it be weigh'd\nBy it self, with aggravations not surcharg'd,\nOr else with just allowance counterpois'd\nI may, if possible, thy pardon find\nThe easier towards me, or thy hatred less.\nFirst granting, as I do, it was a weakness\nIn me, but incident to all our sex,\nCuriosity, inquisitive, importune\nOf secrets, then with like infirmity\nTo publish them, both common female faults:\nWas it not weakness also to make known\nFor importunity, that is for naught,\nWherein consisted all thy strength and safety?\nTo what I did thou shewdst me first the way.\nBut I to enemies reveal'd, and should not.\nNor shouldst thou have trusted that to womans frailty\nE're I to thee, thou to thy self wast cruel.\nLet weakness then with weakness come to parl\nSo near related, or the same of kind,\nThine forgive mine; that men may censure thine\nThe gentler, if severely thou exact not\nMore strength from me, then in thy self was found.\nAnd what if Love, which thou interpret'st hate,\nThe jealousie of Love, powerful of sway\nIn human hearts, nor less in mine towards thee,\nCaus'd what I did? I saw thee mutable\nOf fancy, feard lest one day thou wouldst leave me\nAs her at Timna, sought by all means therefore\nHow to endear, and hold thee to me firmest:\nNo better way I saw then by importuning\nTo learn thy secrets, get into my power\nThy key of strength and safety: thou wilt say,\nWhy then reveal'd? I was assur'd by those\nWho tempted me, that nothing was design'd\nAgainst thee but safe custody, and hold:\nThat made for me, I knew that liberty\nWould draw thee forth to perilous enterprises,\nWhile I at home sate full of cares and fears\nWailing thy absence in my widow'd bed;\nHere I should still enjoy thee day and night\nMine and Loves prisoner, not the Philistines,\nWhole to my self, unhazarded abroad,\nFearless at home of partners in my love.\nThese reasons in Loves law have past for good,\nThough fond and reasonless to some perhaps:\nAnd Love hath oft, well meaning, wrought much wo,\nYet always pity or pardon hath obtain'd.\nBe not unlike all others, not austere\nAs thou art strong, inflexible as steel.\nIf thou in strength all mortals dost exceed,\nIn uncompassionate anger do not so.\n\nSam:  How cunningly the sorceress displays\nHer own transgressions, to upbraid me mine!\nThat malice not repentance brought thee hither,\nBy this appears : I gave, thou say'st, th' example,\nI led the way; bitter reproach, but true,\nI to my self was false e're thou to me,\nSuch pardon therefore as I give my folly,\nTake to thy wicked deed: which when thou seest\nImpartial, self-severe, inexorable,\nThou wilt renounce thy seeking, and much rather\nConfess it feign'd, weakness is thy excuse,\nAnd I believe it, weakness to resist\nPhilistian gold: if weakness may excuse,\nWhat Murtherer, what Traytor, Parricide,\nIncestuous, Sacrilegious, but may plead it?\nAll wickedness is weakness : that plea therefore\nWith God or Man will gain thee no remission.\nBut Love constrain'd thee; call it furious rage\nTo satisfie thy lust: Love seeks to have Love;\nMy love how couldst thou hope, who tookst the way\nTo raise in me inexpiable hate,\nKnowing, as needs I must, by thee betray'd ?\nIn vain thou striv'st to cover shame with shame,\nOr by evasions thy crime uncoverst more.\n\nDal:  Since thou determinst weakness for no plea\nIn man or woman, though to thy own condemning,\nHear what assaults I had, what snares besides,\nWhat sieges girt me round, e're I consented;\nWhich might have aw'd the best resolv'd of men,\nThe constantest to have yielded without blame.\nIt was not gold, as to my charge thou lay'st,\nThat wrought with me: thou know'st the Magistrates\nAnd Princes of my countrey came in person,\nSollicited, commanded, threatn'd, urg'd,\nAdjur'd by all the bonds of civil Duty\nAnd of Religion, press'd how just it was,\nHow honourable, how glorious to entrap\nA common enemy, who had destroy'd\nSuch numbers of our Nation : and the Priest\nWas not behind, but ever at my ear,\nPreaching how meritorious with the gods\nIt would be to ensnare an irreligious\nDishonourer of Dagon : what had I\nTo oppose against such powerful arguments?\nOnly my love of thee held long debate;\nAnd combated in silence all these reasons\nWith hard contest: at length that grounded maxim\nSo rife and celebrated in the mouths\nOf wisest men; that to the public good\nPrivate respects must yield; with grave authority'\nTook full possession of me and prevail'd;\nVertue, as I thought, truth, duty so enjoyning.\n\nSam:  I thought where all thy circling wiles would end;\nIn feign'd Religion, smooth hypocrisie.\nBut had thy love, still odiously pretended,\nBin, as it ought, sincere, it would have taught thee\nFar other reasonings, brought forth other deeds.\nI before all the daughters of my Tribe\nAnd of my Nation chose thee from among\nMy enemies, lov'd thee, as too well thou knew'st,\nToo well, unbosom'd all my secrets to thee,\nNot out of levity, but over-powr'd\nBy thy request, who could deny thee nothing;\nYet now am judg'd an enemy.

But zeal mov'd thee;\nTo please thy gods thou didst it; gods unable\nTo acquit themselves and prosecute their foes\nBut by ungodly deeds, the contradiction\nOf their own deity, Gods cannot be:\nLess therefore to be pleas'd, obey'd, or fear'd,\nThese false pretexts and varnish'd colours failing,\nBare in thy guilt how foul must thou appear?\n\nDal:  In argument with men a woman ever\nGoes by the worse, whatever be her cause.\n\nSam:  For want of words no doubt, or lack of breath,\nWitness when I was worried with thy peals.\n\nDal:  I was a fool, too rash, and quite mistaken\nIn what I thought would have succeeded best.\nLet me obtain forgiveness of thee, Samson,\nAfford me place to shew what recompence\nTowards thee I intend for what I have misdone,\nMisguided: only what remains past cure\nBear not too sensibly, nor still insist\nTo afflict thy self in vain: though sight be lost,\nLife yet hath many solaces, enjoy'd\nWhere other senses want not their delights\nAt home in leisure and domestic ease,\nExempt from many a care and chance to which\nEye-sight exposes daily men abroad.\nI to the Lords will intercede, not doubting\nThir favourable ear, that I may fetch thee\nFrom forth this loathsom prison-house, to abide\nWith me, where my redoubl'd love and care\nWith nursing diligence, to me glad office,\nMay ever tend about thee to old age\nWith all things grateful chear'd, and so suppli'd,\nThat what by me thou hast lost thou least shalt miss.\n\nSam:  No, no, of my condition take no care;\nIt fits not; thou and I long since are twain;\nNor think me so unwary or accurst\nTo bring my feet again into the snare\nWhere once I have been caught; I know thy trains\nThough dearly to my cost, thy ginns, and toyls;\nThy fair enchanted cup, and warbling charms\nNo more on me have power, their force is null'd,\nSo much of Adders wisdom I have learn't\nTo fence my ear against thy sorceries.\nIf in my flower of youth and strength, when all men\nLov'd, honour'd, fear'd me, thou alone could hate me\nThy Husband, slight me, sell me, and forgo me;\nHow wouldst thou use me now, blind, and thereby\nDeceiveable, in most things as a child\nHelpless, thence easily contemn'd, and scorn'd,\nAnd last neglected? How wouldst thou insult\nWhen I must live uxorious to thy will\nIn perfet thraldom, how again betray me,\nBearing my words and doings to the Lords\nTo gloss upon, and censuring, frown or smile?\nThis Gaol I count the house of Liberty\nTo thine whose doors my feet shall never enter.\n\nDal:  Let me approach at least, and touch thy hand.\n\nSam:  Not for thy life, lest fierce remembrance wake\nMy sudden rage to tear thee joint by joint.\nAt distance I forgive thee, go with that;\nBewail thy falshood, and the pious works\nIt hath brought forth to make thee memorable\nAmong illustrious women, faithful wives:\nCherish thy hast'n'd widowhood with the gold\nOf Matrimonial treason: so farewel.\n\nDal:  I see thou art implacable, more deaf\nTo prayers, then winds and seas, yet winds to seas\nAre reconcil'd at length, and Sea to Shore:\nThy anger, unappeasable, still rages,\nEternal tempest never to be calm'd.\nWhy do I humble thus my self, and suing\nFor peace, reap nothing but repulse and hate?\nBid go with evil omen and the brand\nOf infamy upon my name denounc't?\nTo mix with thy concernments I desist\nHenceforth, nor too much disapprove my own.\nFame if not double-fac't is double-mouth'd,\nAnd with contrary blast proclaims most deeds,\nOn both his wings, one black, th' other white,\nBears greatest names in his wild aerie flight.\nMy name perhaps among the Circumcis'd\nIn Dan, in Judah, and the bordering Tribes,\nTo all posterity may stand defam'd,\nWith malediction mention'd, and the blot\nOf falshood most unconjugal traduc't.\nBut in my countrey where I most desire,\nIn Ecron, Gaza, Asdod, and in Gath\nI shall be nam'd among the famousest\nOf Women, sung at solemn festivals,\nLiving and dead recorded, who to save\nHer countrey from a fierce destroyer, chose\nAbove the faith of wedlock-bands, my tomb\nWith odours visited and annual flowers.\nNot less renown'd then in Mount Ephraim,\nJael who with inhospitable guile\nSmote Sisera sleeping through the Temples nail'd.\nNor shall I count it hainous to enjoy\nThe public marks of honour and reward\nConferr'd upon me, for the piety\nWhich to my countrey I was judg'd to have shewn.\nAt this who ever envies or repines\nI leave him to his lot, and like my own.\n\nChor:  She's gone, a manifest Serpent by her sting\nDiscover'd in the end, till now conceal'd.\n\nSam:  So let her go, God sent her to debase me,\nAnd aggravate my folly who committed\nTo such a viper his most sacred trust\nOf secresie, my safety, and my life.\n\nChor:  Yet beauty, though injurious, hath strange power,\nAfter offence returning, to regain\nLove once possest, nor can be easily\nRepuls't, without much inward passion felt\nAnd secret sting of amorous remorse.\n\nSam:  Love-quarrels oft in pleasing concord end,\nNot wedlock-trechery endangering life.\n\nChor:  It is not vertue, wisdom, valour, wit,\nStrength, comliness of shape, or amplest merit\nThat womans love can win or long inherit;\nBut what it is, hard is to say,\nHarder to hit,\n(Which way soever men refer it)\nMuch like thy riddle, Samson, in one day\nOr seven, though one should musing sit;\nIf any of these or all, the Timnian bride\nHad not so soon preferr'd\nThy Paranymph, worthless to thee compar'd,\nSuccessour in thy bed,\nNor both so loosly disally'd\nThir nuptials, nor this last so trecherously\nHad shorn the fatal harvest of thy head.\nIs it for that such outward ornament\nWas lavish't on thir Sex, that inward gifts\nWere left for hast unfinish't, judgment scant,\nCapacity not rais'd to apprehend\nOr value what is best\nIn choice, but oftest to affect the wrong?\nOr was too much of self-love mixt,\nOf constancy no root infixt,\nThat either they love nothing, or not long?\nWhat e're it be, to wisest men and best\nSeeming at first all heavenly under virgin veil,\nSoft, modest, meek, demure,\nOnce join'd, the contrary she proves, a thorn\nIntestin, far within defensive arms\nA cleaving mischief, in his way to vertue\nAdverse and turbulent, or by her charms\nDraws him awry enslav'd\nWith dotage, and his sense deprav'd\nTo folly and shameful deeds which ruin ends.\nWhat Pilot so expert but needs must wreck\nEmbarqu'd with such a Stears-mate at the Helm?\nFavour'd of Heav'n who finds\nOne vertuous rarely found,\nThat in domestic good combines:\nHappy that house! his way to peace is smooth:\nBut vertue which breaks through all opposition,\nAnd all temptation can remove,\nMost shines and most is acceptable above.\nTherefore Gods universal Law\nGave to the man despotic power\nOver his female in due awe,\nNor from that right to part an hour,\nSmile she or lowre:\nSo shall he least confusion draw\nOn his whole life, not sway'd\nBy female usurpation, nor dismay'd.\nBut had we best retire, I see a storm?\n\nSam:  Fair days have oft contracted wind and rain.\n\nChor:  But this another kind of tempest brings.\n\nSam:  Be less abstruse, my riddling days are past.\n\nChor:  Look now for no inchanting voice, nor fear\nThe bait of honied words; a rougher tongue\nDraws hitherward, I know him by his stride,\nThe Giant Harapha of Gath, his look\nHaughty as is his pile high-built and proud.\nComes he in peace? what wind hath blown him hither\nI less conjecture then when first I saw\nThe sumptuous Dalila floating this way:\nHis habit carries peace, his brow defiance.\n\nSam:  Or peace or not, alike to me he comes.\n\nChor:  His fraught we soon shall know, he now arrives.\n\nHar:  I come not Samson, to condole thy chance,\nAs these perhaps, yet wish it had not been,\nThough for no friendly intent.

for his sleep\nWas aery-light, from pure digestion bred,\nAnd temperate vapours bland, which the only sound\nOf leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan,\nLightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song\nOf birds on every bough; so much the more\nHis wonder was to find unwakened Eve\nWith tresses discomposed, and glowing cheek,\nAs through unquiet rest:  He, on his side\nLeaning half raised, with looks of cordial love\nHung over her enamoured, and beheld\nBeauty, which, whether waking or asleep,\nShot forth peculiar graces; then with voice\nMild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,\nHer hand soft touching, whispered thus.  Awake,\nMy fairest, my espoused, my latest found,\nHeaven's last best gift, my ever new delight!\nAwake:  The morning shines, and the fresh field\nCalls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring\nOur tender plants, how blows the citron grove,\nWhat drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,\nHow nature paints her colours, how the bee\nSits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.\nSuch whispering waked her, but with startled eye\nOn Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.\nO sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,\nMy glory, my perfection! glad I see\nThy face, and morn returned; for I this night\n(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,\nIf dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,\nWorks of day past, or morrow's next design,\nBut of offence and trouble, which my mind\nKnew never till this irksome night:  Methought,\nClose at mine ear one called me forth to walk\nWith gentle voice;  I thought it thine: It said,\n'Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,\n'The cool, the silent, save where silence yields\n'To the night-warbling bird, that now awake\n'Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns\n'Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light\n'Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,\n'If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,\n'Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire?\n'In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment\n'Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.'\nI rose as at thy call, but found thee not;\nTo find thee I directed then my walk;\nAnd on, methought, alone I passed through ways\nThat brought me on a sudden to the tree\nOf interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,\nMuch fairer to my fancy than by day:\nAnd, as I wondering looked, beside it stood\nOne shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven\nBy us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled\nAmbrosia; on that tree he also gazed;\nAnd 'O fair plant,' said he, 'with fruit surcharged,\n'Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,\n'Nor God, nor Man?  Is knowledge so despised?\n'Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?\n'Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold\n'Longer thy offered good; why else set here?\nThis said, he paused not, but with venturous arm\nHe plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled\nAt such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:\nBut he thus, overjoyed; 'O fruit divine,\n'Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,\n'Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit\n'For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:\n'And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more\n'Communicated, more abundant grows,\n'The author not impaired, but honoured more?\n'Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!\n'Partake thou also; happy though thou art,\n'Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:\n'Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods\n'Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,\n'But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes\n'Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see\n'What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!'\nSo saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,\nEven to my mouth of that same fruit held part\nWhich he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell\nSo quickened appetite, that I, methought,\nCould not but taste.  Forthwith up to the clouds\nWith him I flew, and underneath beheld\nThe earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide\nAnd various:  Wondering at my flight and change\nTo this high exaltation; suddenly\nMy guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,\nAnd fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked\nTo find this but a dream!  Thus Eve her night\nRelated, and thus Adam answered sad.\nBest image of myself, and dearer half,\nThe trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep\nAffects me equally; nor can I like\nThis uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;\nYet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,\nCreated pure.  But know that in the soul\nAre many lesser faculties, that serve\nReason as chief; among these Fancy next\nHer office holds; of all external things\nWhich the five watchful senses represent,\nShe forms imaginations, aery shapes,\nWhich Reason, joining or disjoining, frames\nAll what we affirm or what deny, and call\nOur knowledge or opinion; then retires\nInto her private cell, when nature rests.\nOft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes\nTo imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,\nWild work produces oft, and most in dreams;\nIll matching words and deeds long past or late.\nSome such resemblances, methinks, I find\nOf our last evening's talk, in this thy dream,\nBut with addition strange; yet be not sad.\nEvil into the mind of God or Man\nMay come and go, so unreproved, and leave\nNo spot or blame behind:  Which gives me hope\nThat what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,\nWaking thou never will consent to do.\nBe not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,\nThat wont to be more cheerful and serene,\nThan when fair morning first smiles on the world;\nAnd let us to our fresh employments rise\nAmong the groves, the fountains, and the flowers\nThat open now their choisest bosomed smells,\nReserved from night, and kept for thee in store.\nSo cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;\nBut silently a gentle tear let fall\nFrom either eye, and wiped them with her hair;\nTwo other precious drops that ready stood,\nEach in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell\nKissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse\nAnd pious awe, that feared to have offended.\nSo all was cleared, and to the field they haste.\nBut first, from under shady arborous roof\nSoon as they forth were come to open sight\nOf day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,\nWith wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,\nShot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,\nDiscovering in wide landskip all the east\nOf Paradise and Eden's happy plains,\nLowly they bowed adoring, and began\nTheir orisons, each morning duly paid\nIn various style; for neither various style\nNor holy rapture wanted they to praise\nTheir Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung\nUnmeditated; such prompt eloquence\nFlowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,\nMore tuneable than needed lute or harp\nTo add more sweetness; and they thus began.\nThese are thy glorious works, Parent of good,\nAlmighty!  Thine this universal frame,\nThus wonderous fair;  Thyself how wonderous then!\nUnspeakable, who sitst above these heavens\nTo us invisible, or dimly seen\nIn these thy lowest works; yet these declare\nThy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.\nSpeak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,\nAngels; for ye behold him, and with songs\nAnd choral symphonies, day without night,\nCircle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven\nOn Earth join all ye Creatures to extol\nHim first, him last, him midst, and without end.\nFairest of stars, last in the train of night,\nIf better thou belong not to the dawn,\nSure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn\nWith thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,\nWhile day arises, that sweet hour of prime.\nThou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,\nAcknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise\nIn thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,\nAnd when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.\nMoon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,\nWith the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;\nAnd ye five other wandering Fires, that move\nIn mystick dance not without song, resound\nHis praise, who out of darkness called up light.\nAir, and ye Elements, the eldest birth\nOf Nature's womb, that in quaternion run\nPerpetual circle, multiform; and mix\nAnd nourish all things; let your ceaseless change\nVary to our great Maker still new praise.\nYe Mists and Exhalations, that now rise\nFrom hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,\nTill the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,\nIn honour to the world's great Author rise;\nWhether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,\nOr wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,\nRising or falling still advance his praise.\nHis praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,\nBreathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,\nWith every plant, in sign of worship wave.\nFountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,\nMelodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.\nJoin voices, all ye living Souls:  Ye Birds,\nThat singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,\nBear on your wings and in your notes his praise.\nYe that in waters glide, and ye that walk\nThe earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;\nWitness if I be silent, morn or even,\nTo hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,\nMade vocal by my song, and taught his praise.\nHail, universal Lord, be bounteous still\nTo give us only good; and if the night\nHave gathered aught of evil, or concealed,\nDisperse it, as now light dispels the dark!\nSo prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts\nFirm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.\nOn to their morning's rural work they haste,\nAmong sweet dews and flowers; where any row\nOf fruit-trees over-woody reached too far\nTheir pampered boughs, and needed hands to check\nFruitless embraces: or they led the vine\nTo wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines\nHer marriageable arms, and with him brings\nHer dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn\nHis barren leaves.  Them thus employed beheld\nWith pity Heaven's high King, and to him called\nRaphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned\nTo travel with Tobias, and secured\nHis marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.\nRaphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth\nSatan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf,\nHath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed\nThis night the human pair; how he designs\nIn them at once to ruin all mankind.\nGo therefore, half this day as friend with friend\nConverse with Adam, in what bower or shade\nThou findest him from the heat of noon retired,\nTo respite his day-labour with repast,\nOr with repose; and such discourse bring on,\nAs may advise him of his happy state,\nHappiness in his power left free to will,\nLeft to his own free will, his will though free,\nYet mutable; whence warn him to beware\nHe swerve not, too secure:  Tell him withal\nHis danger, and from whom; what enemy,\nLate fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now\nThe fall of others from like state of bliss;\nBy violence? no, for that shall be withstood;\nBut by deceit and lies:  This let him know,\nLest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend\nSurprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.\nSo spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled\nAll justice:  Nor delayed the winged Saint\nAfter his charge received; but from among\nThousand celestial Ardours, where he stood\nVeiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,\nFlew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,\nOn each hand parting, to his speed gave way\nThrough all the empyreal road; till, at the gate\nOf Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide\nOn golden hinges turning, as by work\nDivine the sovran Architect had framed.\nFrom hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,\nStar interposed, however small he sees,\nNot unconformed to other shining globes,\nEarth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned\nAbove all hills.  As when by night the glass\nOf Galileo, less assured, observes\nImagined lands and regions in the moon:\nOr pilot, from amidst the Cyclades\nDelos or Samos first appearing, kens\nA cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight\nHe speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky\nSails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing\nNow on the polar winds, then with quick fan\nWinnows the buxom air; till, within soar\nOf towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems\nA phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,\nWhen, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's\nBright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.\nAt once on the eastern cliff of Paradise\nHe lights, and to his proper shape returns\nA Seraph winged:  Six wings he wore, to shade\nHis lineaments divine; the pair that clad\nEach shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast\nWith regal ornament; the middle pair\nGirt like a starry zone his waist, and round\nSkirted his loins and thighs with downy gold\nAnd colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet\nShadowed from either heel with feathered mail,\nSky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood,\nAnd shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled\nThe circuit wide.  Straight knew him all the bands\nOf Angels under watch; and to his state,\nAnd to his message high, in honour rise;\nFor on some message high they guessed him bound.\nTheir glittering tents he passed, and now is come\nInto the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,\nAnd flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;\nA wilderness of sweets; for Nature here\nWantoned as in her prime, and played at will\nHer virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,\nWild above rule or art, enormous bliss.\nHim through the spicy forest onward come\nAdam discerned, as in the door he sat\nOf his cool bower, while now the mounted sun\nShot down direct his fervid rays to warm\nEarth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:\nAnd Eve within, due at her hour prepared\nFor dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please\nTrue appetite, and not disrelish thirst\nOf nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,\nBerry or grape:  To whom thus Adam called.\nHaste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold\nEastward among those trees, what glorious shape\nComes this way moving; seems another morn\nRisen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven\nTo us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe\nThis day to be our guest.  But go with speed,\nAnd, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour\nAbundance, fit to honour and receive\nOur heavenly stranger:  Well we may afford\nOur givers their own gifts, and large bestow\nFrom large bestowed, where Nature multiplies\nHer fertile growth, and by disburthening grows\nMore fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.\nTo whom thus Eve.  Adam, earth's hallowed mould,\nOf God inspired! small store will serve, where store,\nAll seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;\nSave what by frugal storing firmness gains\nTo nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:\nBut I will haste, and from each bough and brake,\nEach plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice\nTo entertain our Angel-guest, as he\nBeholding shall confess, that here on Earth\nGod hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.\nSo saying, with dispatchful looks in haste\nShe turns, on hospitable thoughts intent\nWhat choice to choose for delicacy best,\nWhat order, so contrived as not to mix\nTastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring\nTaste after taste upheld with kindliest change;\nBestirs her then, and from each tender stalk\nWhatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields\nIn India East or West, or middle shore\nIn Pontus or the Punick coast, or where\nAlcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat\nRough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,\nShe gathers, tribute large, and on the board\nHeaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape\nShe crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths\nFrom many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed\nShe tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold\nWants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground\nWith rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.\nMean while our primitive great sire, to meet\nHis God-like guest, walks forth, without more train\nAccompanied than with his own complete\nPerfections; in himself was all his state,\nMore solemn than the tedious pomp that waits\nOn princes, when their rich retinue long\nOf horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold,\nDazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.\nNearer his presence Adam, though not awed,\nYet with submiss approach and reverence meek,\nAs to a superiour nature bowing low,\nThus said.  Native of Heaven, for other place\nNone can than Heaven such glorious shape contain;\nSince, by descending from the thrones above,\nThose happy places thou hast deigned a while\nTo want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us\nTwo only, who yet by sovran gift possess\nThis spacious ground, in yonder shady bower\nTo rest; and what the garden choicest bears\nTo sit and taste, till this meridian heat\nBe over, and the sun more cool decline.\nWhom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.\nAdam, I therefore came; nor art thou such\nCreated, or such place hast here to dwell,\nAs may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,\nTo visit thee; lead on then where thy bower\nO'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,\nI have at will.  So to the sylvan lodge\nThey came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled,\nWith flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,\nUndecked save with herself, more lovely fair\nThan Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned\nOf three that in mount Ida naked strove,\nStood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil\nShe needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm\nAltered her cheek.  On whom the Angel Hail\nBestowed, the holy salutation used\nLong after to blest Mary, second Eve.\nHail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb\nShall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,\nThan with these various fruits the trees of God\nHave heaped this table!--Raised of grassy turf\nTheir table was, and mossy seats had round,\nAnd on her ample square from side to side\nAll autumn piled, though spring and autumn here\nDanced hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;\nNo fear lest dinner cool; when thus began\nOur author.  Heavenly stranger, please to taste\nThese bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom\nAll perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,\nTo us for food and for delight hath caused\nThe earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps\nTo spiritual natures; only this I know,\nThat one celestial Father gives to all.\nTo whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives\n(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part\nSpiritual, may of purest Spirits be found\nNo ingrateful food:  And food alike those pure\nIntelligential substances require,\nAs doth your rational; and both contain\nWithin them every lower faculty\nOf sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,\nTasting concoct, digest, assimilate,\nAnd corporeal to incorporeal turn.\nFor know, whatever was created, needs\nTo be sustained and fed:  Of elements\nThe grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,\nEarth and the sea feed air, the air those fires\nEthereal, and as lowest first the moon;\nWhence in her visage round those spots, unpurged\nVapours not yet into her substance turned.\nNor doth the moon no nourishment exhale\nFrom her moist continent to higher orbs.\nThe sun that light imparts to all, receives\nFrom all his alimental recompence\nIn humid exhalations, and at even\nSups with the ocean.  Though in Heaven the trees\nOf life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines\nYield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn\nWe brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground\nCovered with pearly grain:  Yet God hath here\nVaried his bounty so with new delights,\nAs may compare with Heaven; and to taste\nThink not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,\nAnd to their viands fell; nor seemingly\nThe Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss\nOf Theologians; but with keen dispatch\nOf real hunger, and concoctive heat\nTo transubstantiate:  What redounds, transpires\nThrough Spirits with ease; nor wonder;if by fire\nOf sooty coal the empirick alchemist\nCan turn, or holds it possible to turn,\nMetals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,\nAs from the mine.  Mean while at table Eve\nMinistered naked, and their flowing cups\nWith pleasant liquours crowned:  O innocence\nDeserving Paradise! if ever, then,\nThen had the sons of God excuse to have been\nEnamoured at that sight; but in those hearts\nLove unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy\nWas understood, the injured lover's hell.\nThus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,\nNot burdened nature, sudden mind arose\nIn Adam, not to let the occasion pass\nGiven him by this great conference to know\nOf things above his world, and of their being\nWho dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw\nTranscend his own so far; whose radiant forms,\nDivine effulgence, whose high power, so far\nExceeded human; and his wary speech\nThus to the empyreal minister he framed.\nInhabitant with God, now know I well\nThy favour, in this honour done to Man;\nUnder whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed\nTo enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,\nFood not of Angels, yet accepted so,\nAs that more willingly thou couldst not seem\nAt Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare\nTo whom the winged Hierarch replied.\nO Adam, One Almighty is, from whom\nAll things proceed, and up to him return,\nIf not depraved from good, created all\nSuch to perfection, one first matter all,\nEndued with various forms, various degrees\nOf substance, and, in things that live, of life;\nBut more refined, more spiritous, and pure,\nAs nearer to him placed, or nearer tending\nEach in their several active spheres assigned,\nTill body up to spirit work, in bounds\nProportioned to each kind.  So from the root\nSprings lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves\nMore aery, last the bright consummate flower\nSpirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,\nMan's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,\nTo vital spirits aspire, to animal,\nTo intellectual; give both life and sense,\nFancy and understanding; whence the soul\nReason receives, and reason is her being,\nDiscursive, or intuitive; discourse\nIs oftest yours, the latter most is ours,\nDiffering but in degree, of kind the same.\nWonder not then, what God for you saw good\nIf I refuse not, but convert, as you\nTo proper substance.  Time may come, when Men\nWith Angels may participate, and find\nNo inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;\nAnd from these corporal nutriments perhaps\nYour bodies may at last turn all to spirit,\nImproved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend\nEthereal, as we; or may, at choice,\nHere or in heavenly Paradises dwell;\nIf ye be found obedient, and retain\nUnalterably firm his love entire,\nWhose progeny you are.  Mean while enjoy\nYour fill what happiness this happy state\nCan comprehend, incapable of more.\nTo whom the patriarch of mankind replied.\nO favourable Spirit, propitious guest,\nWell hast thou taught the way that might direct\nOur knowledge, and the scale of nature set\nFrom center to circumference; whereon,\nIn contemplation of created things,\nBy steps we may ascend to God.  But say,\nWhat meant that caution joined, If ye be found\nObedient?  Can we want obedience then\nTo him, or possibly his love desert,\nWho formed us from the dust and placed us here\nFull to the utmost measure of what bliss\nHuman desires can seek or apprehend?\nTo whom the Angel.  Son of Heaven and Earth,\nAttend!  That thou art happy, owe to God;\nThat thou continuest such, owe to thyself,\nThat is, to thy obedience; therein stand.\nThis was that caution given thee; be advised.\nGod made thee perfect, not immutable;\nAnd good he made thee, but to persevere\nHe left it in thy power; ordained thy will\nBy nature free, not over-ruled by fate\nInextricable, or strict necessity:\nOur voluntary service he requires,\nNot our necessitated; such with him\nFinds no acceptance, nor can find; for how\nCan hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve\nWilling or no, who will but what they must\nBy destiny, and can no other choose?\nMyself, and all the angelick host, that stand\nIn sight of God, enthroned, our happy state\nHold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;\nOn other surety none:  Freely we serve,\nBecause we freely love, as in our will\nTo love or not; in this we stand or fall:\nAnd some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,\nAnd so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall\nFrom what high state of bliss, into what woe!\nTo whom our great progenitor.  Thy words\nAttentive, and with more delighted ear,\nDivine instructer, I have heard, than when\nCherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills\nAereal musick send:  Nor knew I not\nTo be both will and deed created free;\nYet that we never shall forget to love\nOur Maker, and obey him whose command\nSingle is yet so just, my constant thoughts\nAssured me, and still assure:  Though what thou tellest\nHath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,\nBut more desire to hear, if thou consent,\nThe full relation, which must needs be strange,\nWorthy of sacred silence to be heard;\nAnd we have yet large day, for scarce the sun\nHath finished half his journey, and scarce begins\nHis other half in the great zone of Heaven.\nThus Adam made request; and Raphael,\nAfter short pause assenting, thus began.\nHigh matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men,\nSad task and hard:  For how shall I relate\nTo human sense the invisible exploits\nOf warring Spirits? how, without remorse,\nThe ruin of so many glorious once\nAnd perfect while they stood? how last unfold\nThe secrets of another world, perhaps\nNot lawful to reveal? yet for thy good\nThis is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach\nOf human sense, I shall delineate so,\nBy likening spiritual to corporal forms,\nAs may express them best; though what if Earth\nBe but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein\nEach to other like, more than on earth is thought?\nAs yet this world was not, and Chaos wild\nReigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests\nUpon her center poised; when on a day\n(For time, though in eternity, applied\nTo motion, measures all things durable\nBy present, past, and future,) on such day\nAs Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host\nOf Angels by imperial summons called,\nInnumerable before the Almighty's throne\nForthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared\nUnder their Hierarchs in orders bright:\nTen thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,\nStandards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear\nStream in the air, and for distinction serve\nOf hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;\nOr in their glittering tissues bear imblazed\nHoly memorials, acts of zeal and love\nRecorded eminent.  Thus when in orbs\nOf circuit inexpressible they stood,\nOrb within orb, the Father Infinite,\nBy whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,\nAmidst as from a flaming mount, whose top\nBrightness had made invisible, thus spake.\nHear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;\nHear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.\nThis day I have begot whom I declare\nMy only Son, and on this holy hill\nHim have anointed, whom ye now behold\nAt my right hand; your head I him appoint;\nAnd by myself have sworn, to him shall bow\nAll knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:\nUnder his great vice-gerent reign abide\nUnited, as one individual soul,\nFor ever happy:  Him who disobeys,\nMe disobeys, breaks union, and that day,\nCast out from God and blessed vision, falls\nInto utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place\nOrdained without redemption, without end.\nSo spake the Omnipotent, and with his words\nAll seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.\nThat day, as other solemn days, they spent\nIn song and dance about the sacred hill;\nMystical dance, which yonder starry sphere\nOf planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels\nResembles nearest, mazes intricate,\nEccentrick, intervolved, yet regular\nThen most, when most irregular they seem;\nAnd in their motions harmony divine\nSo smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear\nListens delighted.  Evening now approached,\n(For we have also our evening and our morn,\nWe ours for change delectable, not need;)\nForthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn\nDesirous; all in circles as they stood,\nTables are set, and on a sudden piled\nWith Angels food, and rubied nectar flows\nIn pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,\nFruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.\nOn flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,\nThey eat, they drink, and in communion sweet\nQuaff immortality and joy, secure\nOf surfeit, where full measure only bounds\nExcess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered\nWith copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.\nNow when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled\nFrom that high mount of God, whence light and shade\nSpring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed\nTo grateful twilight, (for night comes not there\nIn darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed\nAll but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;\nWide over all the plain, and wider far\nThan all this globous earth in plain outspread,\n(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,\nDispersed in bands and files, their camp extend\nBy living streams among the trees of life,\nPavilions numberless, and sudden reared,\nCelestial tabernacles, where they slept\nFanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,\nMelodious hymns about the sovran throne\nAlternate all night long: but not so waked\nSatan; so call him now, his former name\nIs heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,\nIf not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,\nIn favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught\nWith envy against the Son of God, that day\nHonoured by his great Father, and proclaimed\nMessiah King anointed, could not bear\nThrough pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.\nDeep malice thence conceiving and disdain,\nSoon as midnight brought on the dusky hour\nFriendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved\nWith all his legions to dislodge, and leave\nUnworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,\nContemptuous; and his next subordinate\nAwakening, thus to him in secret spake.\nSleepest thou, Companion dear?  What sleep can close\nThy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree\nOf yesterday, so late hath passed the lips\nOf Heaven's Almighty.  Thou to me thy thoughts\nWast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;\nBoth waking we were one; how then can now\nThy sleep dissent?  New laws thou seest imposed;\nNew laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise\nIn us who serve, new counsels to debate\nWhat doubtful may ensue:  More in this place\nTo utter is not safe.  Assemble thou\nOf all those myriads which we lead the chief;\nTell them, that by command, ere yet dim night\nHer shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,\nAnd all who under me their banners wave,\nHomeward, with flying march, where we possess\nThe quarters of the north; there to prepare\nFit entertainment to receive our King,\nThe great Messiah, and his new commands,\nWho speedily through all the hierarchies\nIntends to pass triumphant, and give laws.\nSo spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused\nBad influence into the unwary breast\nOf his associate:  He together calls,\nOr several one by one, the regent Powers,\nUnder him Regent; tells, as he was taught,\nThat the Most High commanding, now ere night,\nNow ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,\nThe great hierarchal standard was to move;\nTells the suggested cause, and casts between\nAmbiguous words and jealousies, to sound\nOr taint integrity:  But all obeyed\nThe wonted signal, and superiour voice\nOf their great Potentate; for great indeed\nHis name, and high was his degree in Heaven;\nHis countenance, as the morning-star that guides\nThe starry flock, allured them, and with lies\nDrew after him the third part of Heaven's host.\nMean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns\nAbstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,\nAnd from within the golden lamps that burn\nNightly before him, saw without their light\nRebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread\nAmong the sons of morn, what multitudes\nWere banded to oppose his high decree;\nAnd, smiling, to his only Son thus said.\nSon, thou in whom my glory I behold\nIn full resplendence, Heir of all my might,\nNearly it now concerns us to be sure\nOf our Omnipotence, and with what arms\nWe mean to hold what anciently we claim\nOf deity or empire:  Such a foe\nIs rising, who intends to erect his throne\nEqual to ours, throughout the spacious north;\nNor so content, hath in his thought to try\nIn battle, what our power is, or our right.\nLet us advise, and to this hazard draw\nWith speed what force is left, and all employ\nIn our defence; lest unawares we lose\nThis our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.\nTo whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,\nLightning divine, ineffable, serene,\nMade answer.  Mighty Father, thou thy foes\nJustly hast in derision, and, secure,\nLaughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,\nMatter to me of glory, whom their hate\nIllustrates, when they see all regal power\nGiven me to quell their pride, and in event\nKnow whether I be dextrous to subdue\nThy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.\nSo spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,\nFar was advanced on winged speed; an host\nInnumerable as the stars of night,\nOr stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun\nImpearls on every leaf and every flower.\nRegions they passed, the mighty regencies\nOf Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones,\nIn their triple degrees; regions to which\nAll thy dominion, Adam, is no more\nThan what this garden is to all the earth,\nAnd all the sea, from one entire globose\nStretched into longitude; which having passed,\nAt length into the limits of the north\nThey came; and Satan to his royal seat\nHigh on a hill, far blazing, as a mount\nRaised on a mount, with pyramids and towers\nFrom diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold;\nThe palace of great Lucifer, (so call\nThat structure in the dialect of men\nInterpreted,) which not long after, he\nAffecting all equality with God,\nIn imitation of that mount whereon\nMessiah was declared in sight of Heaven,\nThe Mountain of the Congregation called;\nFor thither he assembled all his train,\nPretending so commanded to consult\nAbout the great reception of their King,\nThither to come, and with calumnious art\nOf counterfeited truth thus held their ears.\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;\nIf these magnifick titles yet remain\nNot merely titular, since by decree\nAnother now hath to himself engrossed\nAll power, and us eclipsed under the name\nOf King anointed, for whom all this haste\nOf midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,\nThis only to consult how we may best,\nWith what may be devised of honours new,\nReceive him coming to receive from us\nKnee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!\nToo much to one! but double how endured,\nTo one, and to his image now proclaimed?\nBut what if better counsels might erect\nOur minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?\nWill ye submit your necks, and choose to bend\nThe supple knee?  Ye will not, if I trust\nTo know ye right, or if ye know yourselves\nNatives and sons of Heaven possessed before\nBy none; and if not equal all, yet free,\nEqually free; for orders and degrees\nJar not with liberty, but well consist.\nWho can in reason then, or right, assume\nMonarchy over such as live by right\nHis equals, if in power and splendour less,\nIn freedom equal? or can introduce\nLaw and edict on us, who without law\nErr not? much less for this to be our Lord,\nAnd look for adoration, to the abuse\nOf those imperial titles, which assert\nOur being ordained to govern, not to serve.\nThus far his bold discourse without controul\nHad audience; when among the Seraphim\nAbdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored\nThe Deity, and divine commands obeyed,\nStood up, and in a flame of zeal severe\nThe current of his fury thus opposed.\nO argument blasphemous, false, and proud!\nWords which no ear ever to hear in Heaven\nExpected, least of all from thee,  Ingrate,\nIn place thyself so high above thy peers.\nCanst thou with impious obloquy condemn\nThe just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,\nThat to his only Son, by right endued\nWith regal scepter, every soul in Heaven\nShall bend the knee, and in that honour due\nConfess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,\nFlatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,\nAnd equal over equals to let reign,\nOne over all with unsucceeded power.\nShalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute\nWith him the points of liberty, who made\nThee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven\nSuch as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?\nYet, by experience taught, we know how good,\nAnd of our good and of our dignity\nHow provident he is; how far from thought\nTo make us less, bent rather to exalt\nOur happy state, under one head more near\nUnited.  But to grant it thee unjust,\nThat equal over equals monarch reign:\nThyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,\nOr all angelick nature joined in one,\nEqual to him begotten Son? by whom,\nAs by his Word, the Mighty Father made\nAll things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven\nBy him created in their bright degrees,\nCrowned them with glory, and to their glory named\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,\nEssential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,\nBut more illustrious made; since he the head\nOne of our number thus reduced becomes;\nHis laws our laws; all honour to him done\nReturns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,\nAnd tempt not these; but hasten to appease\nThe incensed Father, and the incensed Son,\nWhile pardon may be found in time besought.\nSo spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal\nNone seconded, as out of season judged,\nOr singular and rash:  Whereat rejoiced\nThe Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.\nThat we were formed then sayest thou? and the work\nOf secondary hands, by task transferred\nFrom Father to his Son? strange point and new!\nDoctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw\nWhen this creation was? rememberest thou\nThy making, while the Maker gave thee being?\nWe know no time when we were not as now;\nKnow none before us, self-begot, self-raised\nBy our own quickening power, when fatal course\nHad circled his full orb, the birth mature\nOf this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.\nOur puissance is our own; our own right hand\nShall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try\nWho is our equal:  Then thou shalt behold\nWhether by supplication we intend\nAddress, and to begirt the almighty throne\nBeseeching or besieging.  This report,\nThese tidings carry to the anointed King;\nAnd fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.\nHe said; and, as the sound of waters deep,\nHoarse murmur echoed to his words applause\nThrough the infinite host; nor less for that\nThe flaming Seraph fearless, though alone\nEncompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.\nO alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,\nForsaken of all good!  I see thy fall\nDetermined, and thy hapless crew involved\nIn this perfidious fraud, contagion spread\nBoth of thy crime and punishment:  Henceforth\nNo more be troubled how to quit the yoke\nOf God's Messiah; those indulgent laws\nWill not be now vouchsafed; other decrees\nAgainst thee are gone forth without recall;\nThat golden scepter, which thou didst reject,\nIs now an iron rod to bruise and break\nThy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise;\nYet not for thy advice or threats I fly\nThese wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath\nImpendent, raging into sudden flame,\nDistinguish not:  For soon expect to feel\nHis thunder on thy head, devouring fire.\nThen who created thee lamenting learn,\nWhen who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.\nSo spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found\nAmong the faithless, faithful only he;\nAmong innumerable false, unmoved,\nUnshaken, unseduced, unterrified,\nHis loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;\nNor number, nor example, with him wrought\nTo swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,\nThough single.  From amidst them forth he passed,\nLong way through hostile scorn, which he sustained\nSuperiour, nor of violence feared aught;\nAnd, with retorted scorn, his back he turned\nOn those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.","title":"Paradise Lost: Book 05"},{"lines":"High on a throne of royal state, which far\nOutshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind,\nOr where the gorgeous East with richest hand\nShowers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,\nSatan exalted sat, by merit raised\nTo that bad eminence; and, from despair\nThus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires\nBeyond thus high, insatiate to pursue\nVain war with Heaven; and, by success untaught,\nHis proud imaginations thus displayed:--\n  \"Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven!--\nFor, since no deep within her gulf can hold\nImmortal vigour, though oppressed and fallen,\nI give not Heaven for lost: from this descent\nCelestial Virtues rising will appear\nMore glorious and more dread than from no fall,\nAnd trust themselves to fear no second fate!--\nMe though just right, and the fixed laws of Heaven,\nDid first create your leader--next, free choice\nWith what besides in council or in fight\nHath been achieved of merit--yet this loss,\nThus far at least recovered, hath much more\nEstablished in a safe, unenvied throne,\nYielded with full consent. The happier state\nIn Heaven, which follows dignity, might draw\nEnvy from each inferior; but who here\nWill envy whom the highest place exposes\nForemost to stand against the Thunderer's aim\nYour bulwark, and condemns to greatest share\nOf endless pain? Where there is, then, no good\nFor which to strive, no strife can grow up there\nFrom faction: for none sure will claim in Hell\nPrecedence; none whose portion is so small\nOf present pain that with ambitious mind\nWill covet more! With this advantage, then,\nTo union, and firm faith, and firm accord,\nMore than can be in Heaven, we now return\nTo claim our just inheritance of old,\nSurer to prosper than prosperity\nCould have assured us; and by what best way,\nWhether of open war or covert guile,\nWe now debate. Who can advise may speak.\"\n  He ceased; and next him Moloch, sceptred king,\nStood up--the strongest and the fiercest Spirit\nThat fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair.\nHis trust was with th' Eternal to be deemed\nEqual in strength, and rather than be less\nCared not to be at all; with that care lost\nWent all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse,\nHe recked not, and these words thereafter spake:--\n  \"My sentence is for open war. Of wiles,\nMore unexpert, I boast not: them let those\nContrive who need, or when they need; not now.\nFor, while they sit contriving, shall the rest--\nMillions that stand in arms, and longing wait\nThe signal to ascend--sit lingering here,\nHeaven's fugitives, and for their dwelling-place\nAccept this dark opprobrious den of shame,\nThe prison of his ryranny who reigns\nBy our delay? No! let us rather choose,\nArmed with Hell-flames and fury, all at once\nO'er Heaven's high towers to force resistless way,\nTurning our tortures into horrid arms\nAgainst the Torturer; when, to meet the noise\nOf his almighty engine, he shall hear\nInfernal thunder, and, for lightning, see\nBlack fire and horror shot with equal rage\nAmong his Angels, and his throne itself\nMixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire,\nHis own invented torments. But perhaps\nThe way seems difficult, and steep to scale\nWith upright wing against a higher foe!\nLet such bethink them, if the sleepy drench\nOf that forgetful lake benumb not still,\nThat in our porper motion we ascend\nUp to our native seat; descent and fall\nTo us is adverse. Who but felt of late,\nWhen the fierce foe hung on our broken rear\nInsulting, and pursued us through the Deep,\nWith what compulsion and laborious flight\nWe sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easy, then;\nTh' event is feared! Should we again provoke\nOur stronger, some worse way his wrath may find\nTo our destruction, if there be in Hell\nFear to be worse destroyed! What can be worse\nThan to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned\nIn this abhorred deep to utter woe!\nWhere pain of unextinguishable fire\nMust exercise us without hope of end\nThe vassals of his anger, when the scourge\nInexorably, and the torturing hour,\nCalls us to penance? More destroyed than thus,\nWe should be quite abolished, and expire.\nWhat fear we then? what doubt we to incense\nHis utmost ire? which, to the height enraged,\nWill either quite consume us, and reduce\nTo nothing this essential--happier far\nThan miserable to have eternal being!--\nOr, if our substance be indeed divine,\nAnd cannot cease to be, we are at worst\nOn this side nothing; and by proof we feel\nOur power sufficient to disturb his Heaven,\nAnd with perpetual inroads to alarm,\nThough inaccessible, his fatal throne:\nWhich, if not victory, is yet revenge.\"\n  He ended frowning, and his look denounced\nDesperate revenge, and battle dangerous\nTo less than gods. On th' other side up rose\nBelial, in act more graceful and humane.\nA fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed\nFor dignity composed, and high exploit.\nBut all was false and hollow; though his tongue\nDropped manna, and could make the worse appear\nThe better reason, to perplex and dash\nMaturest counsels: for his thoughts were low--\n To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds\nTimorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear,\nAnd with persuasive accent thus began:--\n  \"I should be much for open war, O Peers,\nAs not behind in hate, if what was urged\nMain reason to persuade immediate war\nDid not dissuade me most, and seem to cast\nOminous conjecture on the whole success;\nWhen he who most excels in fact of arms,\nIn what he counsels and in what excels\nMistrustful, grounds his courage on despair\nAnd utter dissolution, as the scope\nOf all his aim, after some dire revenge.\nFirst, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled\nWith armed watch, that render all access\nImpregnable: oft on the bodering Deep\nEncamp their legions, or with obscure wing\nScout far and wide into the realm of Night,\nScorning surprise. Or, could we break our way\nBy force, and at our heels all Hell should rise\nWith blackest insurrection to confound\nHeaven's purest light, yet our great Enemy,\nAll incorruptible, would on his throne\nSit unpolluted, and th' ethereal mould,\nIncapable of stain, would soon expel\nHer mischief, and purge off the baser fire,\nVictorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope\nIs flat despair: we must exasperate\nTh' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage;\nAnd that must end us; that must be our cure--\nTo be no more. Sad cure! for who would lose,\nThough full of pain, this intellectual being,\nThose thoughts that wander through eternity,\nTo perish rather, swallowed up and lost\nIn the wide womb of uncreated Night,\nDevoid of sense and motion? And who knows,\nLet this be good, whether our angry Foe\nCan give it, or will ever? How he can\nIs doubtful; that he never will is sure.\nWill he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,\nBelike through impotence or unaware,\nTo give his enemies their wish, and end\nThem in his anger whom his anger saves\nTo punish endless? 'Wherefore cease we, then?'\nSay they who counsel war; 'we are decreed,\nReserved, and destined to eternal woe;\nWhatever doing, what can we suffer more,\nWhat can we suffer worse?' Is this, then, worst--\nThus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms?\nWhat when we fled amain, pursued and struck\nWith Heaven's afflicting thunder, and besought\nThe Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed\nA refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay\nChained on the burning lake? That sure was worse.\nWhat if the breath that kindled those grim fires,\nAwaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage,\nAnd plunge us in the flames; or from above\nShould intermitted vengeance arm again\nHis red right hand to plague us? What if all\nHer stores were opened, and this firmament\nOf Hell should spout her cataracts of fire,\nImpendent horrors, threatening hideous fall\nOne day upon our heads; while we perhaps,\nDesigning or exhorting glorious war,\nCaught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled,\nEach on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey\nOr racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk\nUnder yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains,\nThere to converse with everlasting groans,\nUnrespited, unpitied, unreprieved,\nAges of hopeless end? This would be worse.\nWar, therefore, open or concealed, alike\nMy voice dissuades; for what can force or guile\nWith him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye\nViews all things at one view? He from Heaven's height\nAll these our motions vain sees and derides,\nNot more almighty to resist our might\nThan wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.\nShall we, then, live thus vile--the race of Heaven\nThus trampled, thus expelled, to suffer here\nChains and these torments? Better these than worse,\nBy my advice; since fate inevitable\nSubdues us, and omnipotent decree,\nThe Victor's will. To suffer, as to do,\nOur strength is equal; nor the law unjust\nThat so ordains. This was at first resolved,\nIf we were wise, against so great a foe\nContending, and so doubtful what might fall.\nI laugh when those who at the spear are bold\nAnd venturous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear\nWhat yet they know must follow--to endure\nExile, or igominy, or bonds, or pain,\nThe sentence of their Conqueror. This is now\nOur doom; which if we can sustain and bear,\nOur Supreme Foe in time may much remit\nHis anger, and perhaps, thus far removed,\nNot mind us not offending, satisfied\nWith what is punished; whence these raging fires\nWill slacken, if his breath stir not their flames.\nOur purer essence then will overcome\nTheir noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel;\nOr, changed at length, and to the place conformed\nIn temper and in nature, will receive\nFamiliar the fierce heat; and, void of pain,\nThis horror will grow mild, this darkness light;\nBesides what hope the never-ending flight\nOf future days may bring, what chance, what change\nWorth waiting--since our present lot appears\nFor happy though but ill, for ill not worst,\nIf we procure not to ourselves more woe.\"\n  Thus Belial, with words clothed in reason's garb,\nCounselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth,\nNot peace; and after him thus Mammon spake:--\n  \"Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven\nWe war, if war be best, or to regain\nOur own right lost. Him to unthrone we then\nMay hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield\nTo fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife.\nThe former, vain to hope, argues as vain\nThe latter; for what place can be for us\nWithin Heaven's bound, unless Heaven's Lord supreme\nWe overpower? Suppose he should relent\nAnd publish grace to all, on promise made\nOf new subjection; with what eyes could we\nStand in his presence humble, and receive\nStrict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne\nWith warbled hyms, and to his Godhead sing\nForced hallelujahs, while he lordly sits\nOur envied sovereign, and his altar breathes\nAmbrosial odours and ambrosial flowers,\nOur servile offerings? This must be our task\nIn Heaven, this our delight. How wearisome\nEternity so spent in worship paid\nTo whom we hate! Let us not then pursue,\nBy force impossible, by leave obtained\nUnacceptable, though in Heaven, our state\nOf splendid vassalage; but rather seek\nOur own good from ourselves, and from our own\nLive to ourselves, though in this vast recess,\nFree and to none accountable, preferring\nHard liberty before the easy yoke\nOf servile pomp. Our greatness will appear\nThen most conspicuous when great things of small,\nUseful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse,\nWe can create, and in what place soe'er\nThrive under evil, and work ease out of pain\nThrough labour and endurance. This deep world\nOf darkness do we dread? How oft amidst\nThick clouds and dark doth Heaven's all-ruling Sire\nChoose to reside, his glory unobscured,\nAnd with the majesty of darkness round\nCovers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar.\nMustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell!\nAs he our darkness, cannot we his light\nImitate when we please? This desert soil\nWants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold;\nNor want we skill or art from whence to raise\nMagnificence; and what can Heaven show more?\nOur torments also may, in length of time,\nBecome our elements, these piercing fires\nAs soft as now severe, our temper changed\nInto their temper; which must needs remove\nThe sensible of pain. All things invite\nTo peaceful counsels, and the settled state\nOf order, how in safety best we may\nCompose our present evils, with regard\nOf what we are and where, dismissing quite\nAll thoughts of war. Ye have what I advise.\"\n  He scarce had finished, when such murmur filled\nTh' assembly as when hollow rocks retain\nThe sound of blustering winds, which all night long\nHad roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull\nSeafaring men o'erwatched, whose bark by chance\nOr pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay\nAfter the tempest. Such applause was heard\nAs Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased,\nAdvising peace: for such another field\nThey dreaded worse than Hell; so much the fear\nOf thunder and the sword of Michael\nWrought still within them; and no less desire\nTo found this nether empire, which might rise,\nBy policy and long process of time,\nIn emulation opposite to Heaven.\nWhich when Beelzebub perceived--than whom,\nSatan except, none higher sat--with grave\nAspect he rose, and in his rising seemed\nA pillar of state. Deep on his front engraven\nDeliberation sat, and public care;\nAnd princely counsel in his face yet shone,\nMajestic, though in ruin. Sage he stood\nWith Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear\nThe weight of mightiest monarchies; his look\nDrew audience and attention still as night\nOr summer's noontide air, while thus he spake:--\n  \"Thrones and Imperial Powers, Offspring of Heaven,\nEthereal Virtues! or these titles now\nMust we renounce, and, changing style, be called\nPrinces of Hell? for so the popular vote\nInclines--here to continue, and build up here\nA growing empire; doubtless! while we dream,\nAnd know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed\nThis place our dungeon, not our safe retreat\nBeyond his potent arm, to live exempt\nFrom Heaven's high jurisdiction, in new league\nBanded against his throne, but to remain\nIn strictest bondage, though thus far removed,\nUnder th' inevitable curb, reserved\nHis captive multitude. For he, to be sure,\nIn height or depth, still first and last will reign\nSole king, and of his kingdom lose no part\nBy our revolt, but over Hell extend\nHis empire, and with iron sceptre rule\nUs here, as with his golden those in Heaven.\nWhat sit we then projecting peace and war?\nWar hath determined us and foiled with loss\nIrreparable; terms of peace yet none\nVouchsafed or sought; for what peace will be given\nTo us enslaved, but custody severe,\nAnd stripes and arbitrary punishment\nInflicted? and what peace can we return,\nBut, to our power, hostility and hate,\nUntamed reluctance, and revenge, though slow,\nYet ever plotting how the Conqueror least\nMay reap his conquest, and may least rejoice\nIn doing what we most in suffering feel?\nNor will occasion want, nor shall we need\nWith dangerous expedition to invade\nHeaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege,\nOr ambush from the Deep. What if we find\nSome easier enterprise? There is a place\n(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven\nErr not)--another World, the happy seat\nOf some new race, called Man, about this time\nTo be created like to us, though less\nIn power and excellence, but favoured more\nOf him who rules above; so was his will\nPronounced among the Gods, and by an oath\nThat shook Heaven's whole circumference confirmed.\nThither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn\nWhat creatures there inhabit, of what mould\nOr substance, how endued, and what their power\nAnd where their weakness: how attempted best,\nBy force of subtlety. Though Heaven be shut,\nAnd Heaven's high Arbitrator sit secure\nIn his own strength, this place may lie exposed,\nThe utmost border of his kingdom, left\nTo their defence who hold it: here, perhaps,\nSome advantageous act may be achieved\nBy sudden onset--either with Hell-fire\nTo waste his whole creation, or possess\nAll as our own, and drive, as we were driven,\nThe puny habitants; or, if not drive,\nSeduce them to our party, that their God\nMay prove their foe, and with repenting hand\nAbolish his own works. This would surpass\nCommon revenge, and interrupt his joy\nIn our confusion, and our joy upraise\nIn his disturbance; when his darling sons,\nHurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse\nTheir frail original, and faded bliss--\nFaded so soon! Advise if this be worth\nAttempting, or to sit in darkness here\nHatching vain empires.\" Thus beelzebub\nPleaded his devilish counsel--first devised\nBy Satan, and in part proposed: for whence,\nBut from the author of all ill, could spring\nSo deep a malice, to confound the race\nOf mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell\nTo mingle and involve, done all to spite\nThe great Creator? But their spite still serves\nHis glory to augment. The bold design\nPleased highly those infernal States, and joy\nSparkled in all their eyes: with full assent\nThey vote: whereat his speech he thus renews:--\n\"Well have ye judged, well ended long debate,\nSynod of Gods, and, like to what ye are,\nGreat things resolved, which from the lowest deep\nWill once more lift us up, in spite of fate,\nNearer our ancient seat--perhaps in view\nOf those bright confines, whence, with neighbouring arms,\nAnd opportune excursion, we may chance\nRe-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone\nDwell, not unvisited of Heaven's fair light,\nSecure, and at the brightening orient beam\nPurge off this gloom: the soft delicious air,\nTo heal the scar of these corrosive fires,\nShall breathe her balm. But, first, whom shall we send\nIn search of this new World? whom shall we find\nSufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet\nThe dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss,\nAnd through the palpable obscure find out\nHis uncouth way, or spread his airy flight,\nUpborne with indefatigable wings\nOver the vast abrupt, ere he arrive\nThe happy Isle? What strength, what art, can then\nSuffice, or what evasion bear him safe,\nThrough the strict senteries and stations thick\nOf Angels watching round? Here he had need\nAll circumspection: and we now no less\nChoice in our suffrage; for on whom we send\nThe weight of all, and our last hope, relies.\"\n  This said, he sat; and expectation held\nHis look suspense, awaiting who appeared\nTo second, or oppose, or undertake\nThe perilous attempt. But all sat mute,\nPondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each\nIn other's countenance read his own dismay,\nAstonished. None among the choice and prime\nOf those Heaven-warring champions could be found\nSo hardy as to proffer or accept,\nAlone, the dreadful voyage; till, at last,\nSatan, whom now transcendent glory raised\nAbove his fellows, with monarchal pride\nConscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake:--\n  \"O Progeny of Heaven! Empyreal Thrones!\nWith reason hath deep silence and demur\nSeized us, though undismayed. Long is the way\nAnd hard, that out of Hell leads up to light.\nOur prison strong, this huge convex of fire,\nOutrageous to devour, immures us round\nNinefold; and gates of burning adamant,\nBarred over us, prohibit all egress.\nThese passed, if any pass, the void profound\nOf unessential Night receives him next,\nWide-gaping, and with utter loss of being\nThreatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf.\nIf thence he scape, into whatever world,\nOr unknown region, what remains him less\nThan unknown dangers, and as hard escape?\nBut I should ill become this throne, O Peers,\nAnd this imperial sovereignty, adorned\nWith splendour, armed with power, if aught proposed\nAnd judged of public moment in the shape\nOf difficulty or danger, could deter\nMe from attempting. Wherefore do I assume\nThese royalties, and not refuse to reign,\nRefusing to accept as great a share\nOf hazard as of honour, due alike\nTo him who reigns, and so much to him due\nOf hazard more as he above the rest\nHigh honoured sits? Go, therefore, mighty Powers,\nTerror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home,\nWhile here shall be our home, what best may ease\nThe present misery, and render Hell\nMore tolerable; if there be cure or charm\nTo respite, or deceive, or slack the pain\nOf this ill mansion: intermit no watch\nAgainst a wakeful foe, while I abroad\nThrough all the coasts of dark destruction seek\nDeliverance for us all. This enterprise\nNone shall partake with me.\" Thus saying, rose\nThe Monarch, and prevented all reply;\nPrudent lest, from his resolution raised,\nOthers among the chief might offer now,\nCertain to be refused, what erst they feared,\nAnd, so refused, might in opinion stand\nHis rivals, winning cheap the high repute\nWhich he through hazard huge must earn. But they\nDreaded not more th' adventure than his voice\nForbidding; and at once with him they rose.\nTheir rising all at once was as the sound\nOf thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend\nWith awful reverence prone, and as a God\nExtol him equal to the Highest in Heaven.\nNor failed they to express how much they praised\nThat for the general safety he despised\nHis own: for neither do the Spirits damned\nLose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast\nTheir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,\nOr close ambition varnished o'er with zeal.\n  Thus they their doubtful consultations dark\nEnded, rejoicing in their matchless Chief:\nAs, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds\nAscending, while the north wind sleeps, o'erspread\nHeaven's cheerful face, the louring element\nScowls o'er the darkened landscape snow or shower,\nIf chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet,\nExtend his evening beam, the fields revive,\nThe birds their notes renew, and bleating herds\nAttest their joy, that hill and valley rings.\nO shame to men! Devil with devil damned\nFirm concord holds; men only disagree\nOf creatures rational, though under hope\nOf heavenly grace, and, God proclaiming peace,\nYet live in hatred, enmity, and strife\nAmong themselves, and levy cruel wars\nWasting the earth, each other to destroy:\nAs if (which might induce us to accord)\nMan had not hellish foes enow besides,\nThat day and night for his destruction wait!\n  The Stygian council thus dissolved; and forth\nIn order came the grand infernal Peers:\nMidst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed\nAlone th' antagonist of Heaven, nor less\nThan Hell's dread Emperor, with pomp supreme,\nAnd god-like imitated state: him round\nA globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed\nWith bright emblazonry, and horrent arms.\nThen of their session ended they bid cry\nWith trumpet's regal sound the great result:\nToward the four winds four speedy Cherubim\nPut to their mouths the sounding alchemy,\nBy herald's voice explained; the hollow Abyss\nHeard far adn wide, and all the host of Hell\nWith deafening shout returned them loud acclaim.\nThence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised\nBy false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers\nDisband; and, wandering, each his several way\nPursues, as inclination or sad choice\nLeads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find\nTruce to his restless thoughts, and entertain\nThe irksome hours, till his great Chief return.\nPart on the plain, or in the air sublime,\nUpon the wing or in swift race contend,\nAs at th' Olympian games or Pythian fields;\nPart curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal\nWith rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form:\nAs when, to warn proud cities, war appears\nWaged in the troubled sky, and armies rush\nTo battle in the clouds; before each van\nPrick forth the airy knights, and couch their spears,\nTill thickest legions close; with feats of arms\nFrom either end of heaven the welkin burns.\nOthers, with vast Typhoean rage, more fell,\nRend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air\nIn whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar:--\nAs when Alcides, from Oechalia crowned\nWith conquest, felt th' envenomed robe, and tore\nThrough pain up by the roots Thessalian pines,\nAnd Lichas from the top of Oeta threw\nInto th' Euboic sea. Others, more mild,\nRetreated in a silent valley, sing\nWith notes angelical to many a harp\nTheir own heroic deeds, and hapless fall\nBy doom of battle, and complain that Fate\nFree Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance.\nTheir song was partial; but the harmony\n(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)\nSuspended Hell, and took with ravishment\nThe thronging audience. In discourse more sweet\n(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense)\nOthers apart sat on a hill retired,\nIn thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high\nOf Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate--\nFixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,\nAnd found no end, in wandering mazes lost.\nOf good and evil much they argued then,\nOf happiness and final misery,\nPassion and apathy, and glory and shame:\nVain wisdom all, and false philosophy!--\nYet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm\nPain for a while or anguish, and excite\nFallacious hope, or arm th' obdured breast\nWith stubborn patience as with triple steel.\nAnother part, in squadrons and gross bands,\nOn bold adventure to discover wide\nThat dismal world, if any clime perhaps\nMight yield them easier habitation, bend\nFour ways their flying march, along the banks\nOf four infernal rivers, that disgorge\nInto the burning lake their baleful streams--\nAbhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate;\nSad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;\nCocytus, named of lamentation loud\nHeard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton,\nWhose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.\nFar off from these, a slow and silent stream,\nLethe, the river of oblivion, rolls\nHer watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks\nForthwith his former state and being forgets--\nForgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.\nBeyond this flood a frozen continent\nLies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms\nOf whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land\nThaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems\nOf ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,\nA gulf profound as that Serbonian bog\nBetwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,\nWhere armies whole have sunk: the parching air\nBurns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire.\nThither, by harpy-footed Furies haled,\nAt certain revolutions all the damned\nAre brought; and feel by turns the bitter change\nOf fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,\nFrom beds of raging fire to starve in ice\nTheir soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine\nImmovable, infixed, and frozen round\nPeriods of time,--thence hurried back to fire.\nThey ferry over this Lethean sound\nBoth to and fro, their sorrow to augment,\nAnd wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach\nThe tempting stream, with one small drop to lose\nIn sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,\nAll in one moment, and so near the brink;\nBut Fate withstands, and, to oppose th' attempt,\nMedusa with Gorgonian terror guards\nThe ford, and of itself the water flies\nAll taste of living wight, as once it fled\nThe lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on\nIn confused march forlorn, th' adventurous bands,\nWith shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast,\nViewed first their lamentable lot, and found\nNo rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale\nThey passed, and many a region dolorous,\nO'er many a frozen, many a fiery alp,\nRocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death--\nA universe of death, which God by curse\nCreated evil, for evil only good;\nWhere all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,\nPerverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,\nObominable, inutterable, and worse\nThan fables yet have feigned or fear conceived,\nGorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire.\n  Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man,\nSatan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design,\nPuts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell\nExplores his solitary flight: sometimes\nHe scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left;\nNow shaves with level wing the deep, then soars\nUp to the fiery concave towering high.\nAs when far off at sea a fleet descried\nHangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds\nClose sailing from Bengala, or the isles\nOf Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring\nTheir spicy drugs; they on the trading flood,\nThrough the wide Ethiopian to the Cape,\nPly stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed\nFar off the flying Fiend. At last appear\nHell-bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof,\nAnd thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass,\nThree iron, three of adamantine rock,\nImpenetrable, impaled with circling fire,\nYet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat\nOn either side a formidable Shape.\nThe one seemed woman to the waist, and fair,\nBut ended foul in many a scaly fold,\nVoluminous and vast--a serpent armed\nWith mortal sting. About her middle round\nA cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked\nWith wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung\nA hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep,\nIf aught disturbed their noise, into her womb,\nAnd kennel there; yet there still barked and howled\nWithin unseen. Far less abhorred than these\nVexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts\nCalabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore;\nNor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called\nIn secret, riding through the air she comes,\nLured with the smell of infant blood, to dance\nWith Lapland witches, while the labouring moon\nEclipses at their charms. The other Shape--\nIf shape it might be called that shape had none\nDistinguishable in member, joint, or limb;\nOr substance might be called that shadow seemed,\nFor each seemed either--black it stood as Night,\nFierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,\nAnd shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head\nThe likeness of a kingly crown had on.\nSatan was now at hand, and from his seat\nThe monster moving onward came as fast\nWith horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.\nTh' undaunted Fiend what this might be admired--\nAdmired, not feared (God and his Son except,\nCreated thing naught valued he nor shunned),\nAnd with disdainful look thus first began:--\n  \"Whence and what art thou, execrable Shape,\nThat dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance\nThy miscreated front athwart my way\nTo yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass,\nThat be assured, without leave asked of thee.\nRetire; or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,\nHell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven.\"\n  To whom the Goblin, full of wrath, replied:--\n\"Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he,\nWho first broke peace in Heaven and faith, till then\nUnbroken, and in proud rebellious arms\nDrew after him the third part of Heaven's sons,\nConjured against the Highest--for which both thou\nAnd they, outcast from God, are here condemned\nTo waste eternal days in woe and pain?\nAnd reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven\nHell-doomed, and breath'st defiance here and scorn,\nWhere I reign king, and, to enrage thee more,\nThy king and lord? Back to thy punishment,\nFalse fugitive; and to thy speed add wings,\nLest with a whip of scorpions I pursue\nThy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart\nStrange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before.\"\n  So spake the grisly Terror, and in shape,\nSo speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold,\nMore dreadful and deform. On th' other side,\nIncensed with indignation, Satan stood\nUnterrified, and like a comet burned,\nThat fires the length of Ophiuchus huge\nIn th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair\nShakes pestilence and war. Each at the head\nLevelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands\nNo second stroke intend; and such a frown\nEach cast at th' other as when two black clouds,\nWith heaven's artillery fraught, came rattling on\nOver the Caspian,--then stand front to front\nHovering a space, till winds the signal blow\nTo join their dark encounter in mid-air.\nSo frowned the mighty combatants that Hell\nGrew darker at their frown; so matched they stood;\nFor never but once more was wither like\nTo meet so great a foe. And now great deeds\nHad been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung,\nHad not the snaky Sorceress, that sat\nFast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key,\nRisen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.\n  \"O father, what intends thy hand,\" she cried,\n\"Against thy only son? What fury, O son,\nPossesses thee to bend that mortal dart\nAgainst thy father's head? And know'st for whom?\nFor him who sits above, and laughs the while\nAt thee, ordained his drudge to execute\nWhate'er his wrath, which he calls justice, bids--\nHis wrath, which one day will destroy ye both!\"\n  She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest\nForbore: then these to her Satan returned:--\n  \"So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange\nThou interposest, that my sudden hand,\nPrevented, spares to tell thee yet by deeds\nWhat it intends, till first I know of thee\nWhat thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why,\nIn this infernal vale first met, thou call'st\nMe father, and that phantasm call'st my son.\nI know thee not, nor ever saw till now\nSight more detestable than him and thee.\"\n  T' whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied:--\n\"Hast thou forgot me, then; and do I seem\nNow in thine eye so foul?--once deemed so fair\nIn Heaven, when at th' assembly, and in sight\nOf all the Seraphim with thee combined\nIn bold conspiracy against Heaven's King,\nAll on a sudden miserable pain\nSurprised thee, dim thine eyes and dizzy swum\nIn darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast\nThrew forth, till on the left side opening wide,\nLikest to thee in shape and countenance bright,\nThen shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed,\nOut of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized\nAll th' host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid\nAt first, and called me Sin, and for a sign\nPortentous held me; but, familiar grown,\nI pleased, and with attractive graces won\nThe most averse--thee chiefly, who, full oft\nThyself in me thy perfect image viewing,\nBecam'st enamoured; and such joy thou took'st\nWith me in secret that my womb conceived\nA growing burden. Meanwhile war arose,\nAnd fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained\n(For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe\nClear victory; to our part loss and rout\nThrough all the Empyrean. Down they fell,\nDriven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down\nInto this Deep; and in the general fall\nI also: at which time this powerful key\nInto my hands was given, with charge to keep\nThese gates for ever shut, which none can pass\nWithout my opening. Pensive here I sat\nAlone; but long I sat not, till my womb,\nPregnant by thee, and now excessive grown,\nProdigious motion felt and rueful throes.\nAt last this odious offspring whom thou seest,\nThine own begotten, breaking violent way,\nTore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain\nDistorted, all my nether shape thus grew\nTransformed: but he my inbred enemy\nForth issued, brandishing his fatal dart,\nMade to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death!\nHell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed\nFrom all her caves, and back resounded Death!\nI fled; but he pursued (though more, it seems,\nInflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far,\nMe overtook, his mother, all dismayed,\nAnd, in embraces forcible and foul\nEngendering with me, of that rape begot\nThese yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry\nSurround me, as thou saw'st--hourly conceived\nAnd hourly born, with sorrow infinite\nTo me; for, when they list, into the womb\nThat bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw\nMy bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth\nAfresh, with conscious terrors vex me round,\nThat rest or intermission none I find.\nBefore mine eyes in opposition sits\nGrim Death, my son and foe, who set them on,\nAnd me, his parent, would full soon devour\nFor want of other prey, but that he knows\nHis end with mine involved, and knows that I\nShould prove a bitter morsel, and his bane,\nWhenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced.\nBut thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun\nHis deadly arrow; neither vainly hope\nTo be invulnerable in those bright arms,\nThrough tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint,\nSave he who reigns above, none can resist.\"\n  She finished; and the subtle Fiend his lore\nSoon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth:--\n  \"Dear daughter--since thou claim'st me for thy sire,\nAnd my fair son here show'st me, the dear pledge\nOf dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys\nThen sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change\nBefallen us unforeseen, unthought-of--know,\nI come no enemy, but to set free\nFrom out this dark and dismal house of pain\nBoth him and thee, and all the heavenly host\nOf Spirits that, in our just pretences armed,\nFell with us from on high. From them I go\nThis uncouth errand sole, and one for all\nMyself expose, with lonely steps to tread\nTh' unfounded Deep, and through the void immense\nTo search, with wandering quest, a place foretold\nShould be--and, by concurring signs, ere now\nCreated vast and round--a place of bliss\nIn the purlieus of Heaven; and therein placed\nA race of upstart creatures, to supply\nPerhaps our vacant room, though more removed,\nLest Heaven, surcharged with potent multitude,\nMight hap to move new broils. Be this, or aught\nThan this more secret, now designed, I haste\nTo know; and, this once known, shall soon return,\nAnd bring ye to the place where thou and Death\nShall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen\nWing silently the buxom air, embalmed\nWith odours. There ye shall be fed and filled\nImmeasurably; all things shall be your prey.\"\n  He ceased; for both seemed highly pleased, and Death\nGrinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear\nHis famine should be filled, and blessed his maw\nDestined to that good hour. No less rejoiced\nHis mother bad, and thus bespake her sire:--\n  \"The key of this infernal Pit, by due\nAnd by command of Heaven's all-powerful King,\nI keep, by him forbidden to unlock\nThese adamantine gates; against all force\nDeath ready stands to interpose his dart,\nFearless to be o'ermatched by living might.\nBut what owe I to his commands above,\nWho hates me, and hath hither thrust me down\nInto this gloom of Tartarus profound,\nTo sit in hateful office here confined,\nInhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born--\nHere in perpetual agony and pain,\nWith terrors and with clamours compassed round\nOf mine own brood, that on my bowels feed?\nThou art my father, thou my author, thou\nMy being gav'st me; whom should I obey\nBut thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon\nTo that new world of light and bliss, among\nThe gods who live at ease, where I shall reign\nAt thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems\nThy daughter and thy darling, without end.\"\n  Thus saying, from her side the fatal key,\nSad instrument of all our woe, she took;\nAnd, towards the gate rolling her bestial train,\nForthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew,\nWhich, but herself, not all the Stygian Powers\nCould once have moved; then in the key-hole turns\nTh' intricate wards, and every bolt and bar\nOf massy iron or solid rock with ease\nUnfastens. On a sudden open fly,\nWith impetuous recoil and jarring sound,\nTh' infernal doors, and on their hinges grate\nHarsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook\nOf Erebus. She opened; but to shut\nExcelled her power: the gates wide open stood,\nThat with extended wings a bannered host,\nUnder spread ensigns marching, mibht pass through\nWith horse and chariots ranked in loose array;\nSo wide they stood, and like a furnace-mouth\nCast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame.\nBefore their eyes in sudden view appear\nThe secrets of the hoary Deep--a dark\nIllimitable ocean, without bound,\nWithout dimension; where length, breadth, and height,\nAnd time, and place, are lost; where eldest Night\nAnd Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold\nEternal anarchy, amidst the noise\nOf endless wars, and by confusion stand.\nFor Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce,\nStrive here for mastery, and to battle bring\nTheir embryon atoms: they around the flag\nOf each his faction, in their several clans,\nLight-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow,\nSwarm populous, unnumbered as the sands\nOf Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil,\nLevied to side with warring winds, and poise\nTheir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere\nHe rules a moment: Chaos umpire sits,\nAnd by decision more embroils the fray\nBy which he reigns: next him, high arbiter,\nChance governs all. Into this wild Abyss,\nThe womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave,\nOf neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire,\nBut all these in their pregnant causes mixed\nConfusedly, and which thus must ever fight,\nUnless th' Almighty Maker them ordain\nHis dark materials to create more worlds--\nInto this wild Abyss the wary Fiend\nStood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,\nPondering his voyage; for no narrow frith\nHe had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed\nWith noises loud and ruinous (to compare\nGreat things with small) than when Bellona storms\nWith all her battering engines, bent to rase\nSome capital city; or less than if this frame\nOf Heaven were falling, and these elements\nIn mutiny had from her axle torn\nThe steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans\nHe spread for flight, and, in the surging smoke\nUplifted, spurns the ground; thence many a league,\nAs in a cloudy chair, ascending rides\nAudacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets\nA vast vacuity. All unawares,\nFluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops\nTen thousand fathom deep, and to this hour\nDown had been falling, had not, by ill chance,\nThe strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud,\nInstinct with fire and nitre, hurried him\nAs many miles aloft. That fury stayed--\nQuenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea,\nNor good dry land--nigh foundered, on he fares,\nTreading the crude consistence, half on foot,\nHalf flying; behoves him now both oar and sail.\nAs when a gryphon through the wilderness\nWith winged course, o'er hill or moory dale,\nPursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth\nHad from his wakeful custody purloined\nThe guarded gold; so eagerly the Fiend\nO'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,\nWith head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,\nAnd swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.\nAt length a universal hubbub wild\nOf stunning sounds, and voices all confused,\nBorne through the hollow dark, assaults his ear\nWith loudest vehemence. Thither he plies\nUndaunted, to meet there whatever Power\nOr Spirit of the nethermost Abyss\nMight in that noise reside, of whom to ask\nWhich way the nearest coast of darkness lies\nBordering on light; when straight behold the throne\nOf Chaos, and his dark pavilion spread\nWide on the wasteful Deep! With him enthroned\nSat sable-vested Night, eldest of things,\nThe consort of his reign; and by them stood\nOrcus and Ades, and the dreaded name\nOf Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance,\nAnd Tumult, and Confusion, all embroiled,\nAnd Discord with a thousand various mouths.\n  T' whom Satan, turning boldly, thus:--\"Ye Powers\nAnd Spirtis of this nethermost Abyss,\nChaos and ancient Night, I come no spy\nWith purpose to explore or to disturb\nThe secrets of your realm; but, by constraint\nWandering this darksome desert, as my way\nLies through your spacious empire up to light,\nAlone and without guide, half lost, I seek,\nWhat readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds\nConfine with Heaven; or, if some other place,\nFrom your dominion won, th' Ethereal King\nPossesses lately, thither to arrive\nI travel this profound. Direct my course:\nDirected, no mean recompense it brings\nTo your behoof, if I that region lost,\nAll usurpation thence expelled, reduce\nTo her original darkness and your sway\n(Which is my present journey), and once more\nErect the standard there of ancient Night.\nYours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge!\"\n  Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old,\nWith faltering speech and visage incomposed,\nAnswered:  \"I know thee, stranger, who thou art--  ***\nThat mighty leading Angel, who of late\nMade head against Heaven's King, though overthrown.\nI saw and heard; for such a numerous host\nFled not in silence through the frighted Deep,\nWith ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,\nConfusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates\nPoured out by millions her victorious bands,\nPursuing. I upon my frontiers here\nKeep residence; if all I can will serve\nThat little which is left so to defend,\nEncroached on still through our intestine broils\nWeakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Hell,\nYour dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath;\nNow lately Heaven and Earth, another world\nHung o'er my realm, linked in a golden chain\nTo that side Heaven from whence your legions fell!\nIf that way be your walk, you have not far;\nSo much the nearer danger. Go, and speed;\nHavoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain.\"\n  He ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply,\nBut, glad that now his sea should find a shore,\nWith fresh alacrity and force renewed\nSprings upward, like a pyramid of fire,\nInto the wild expanse, and through the shock\nOf fighting elements, on all sides round\nEnvironed, wins his way; harder beset\nAnd more endangered than when Argo passed\nThrough Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks,\nOr when Ulysses on the larboard shunned\nCharybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steered.\nSo he with difficulty and labour hard\nMoved on, with difficulty and labour he;\nBut, he once passed, soon after, when Man fell,\nStrange alteration! Sin and Death amain,\nFollowing his track (such was the will of Heaven)\nPaved after him a broad and beaten way\nOver the dark Abyss, whose boiling gulf\nTamely endured a bridge of wondrous length,\nFrom Hell continued, reaching th' utmost orb\nOf this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse\nWith easy intercourse pass to and fro\nTo tempt or punish mortals, except whom\nGod and good Angels guard by special grace.\n  But now at last the sacred influence\nOf light appears, and from the walls of Heaven\nShoots far into the bosom of dim Night\nA glimmering dawn.

This way the noise was, if mine ear be true,\nMy best guide now.

I should be loth\nTo meet the rudeness and swilled insolence\nOf such late wassailers; yet, oh! where else\nShall I inform my unacquainted feet\nIn the blind mazes of this tangled wood?\nMy brothers, when they saw me wearied out\nWith this long way, resolving here to lodge\nUnder the spreading favour of these pines,\nStepped, as they said, to the next thicket-side\nTo bring me berries, or such cooling fruit\nAs the kind hospitable woods provide.\nThey left me then when the grey-hooded Even,\nLike a sad votarist in palmer's weed,\nRose from the hindmost wheels of Phoebus' wain.\nBut where they are, and why they came not back,\nIs now the labour of my thoughts.

A thousand fantasies\nBegin to throng into my memory,\nOf calling shapes, and beckoning shadows dire,\nAnd airy tongues that syllable men's names\nOn sands and shores and desert wildernesses.\nThese thoughts may startle well, but not astound\nThe virtuous mind, that ever walks attended\nBy a strong siding champion, Conscience.\nO, welcome, pure-eyed Faith, white-handed Hope,\nThou hovering angel girt with golden wings,\nAnd thou unblemished form of Chastity!\nI see ye visibly, and now believe\nThat He, the Supreme Good, to whom all things ill\nAre but as slavish officers of vengeance,\nWould send a glistering guardian, if need were,\nTo keep my life and honour unassailed. . . .\nWas I deceived, or did a sable cloud\nTurn forth her silver lining on the night?\nI did not err: there does a sable cloud\nTurn forth her silver lining on the night,\nAnd casts a gleam over this tufted grove.\nI cannot hallo to my brothers, but\nSuch noise as I can make to be heard farthest\nI'll venture; for my new-enlivened spirits\nPrompt me, and they perhaps are not far off.\n\nSong.\n\nSweet Echo, sweetest nymph, that liv'st unseen\n                 Within thy airy shell\n         By slow Meander's margent green,\nAnd in the violet-embroidered vale\n         Where the love-lorn nightingale\nNightly to thee her sad song mourneth well:\nCanst thou not tell me of a gentle pair\n         That likest thy Narcissus are?\n                  O, if thou have\n         Hid them in some flowery cave,\n                  Tell me but where,\n         Sweet Queen of Parley, Daughter of the Sphere!\n         So may'st thou be translated to the skies,\nAnd give resounding grace to all Heaven's harmonies!\n\n\n         COMUS. Can any mortal mixture of earthUs mould\nBreathe such divine enchanting ravishment?\nSure something holy lodges in that breast,\nAnd with these raptures moves the vocal air\nTo testify his hidden residence.\nHow sweetly did they float upon the wings\nOf silence, through the empty-vaulted night,\nAt every fall smoothing the raven down\nOf darkness till it smiled! I have oft heard\nMy mother Circe with the Sirens three,\nAmidst the flowery-kirtled Naiades,\nCulling their potent herbs and baleful drugs,\nWho, as they sung, would take the prisoned soul,\nAnd lap it in Elysium: Scylla wept,\nAnd chid her barking waves into attention,\nAnd fell Charybdis murmured soft applause.\nYet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense,\nAnd in sweet madness robbed it of itself;\nBut such a sacred and home-felt delight,\nSuch sober certainty of waking bliss,\nI never heard till now. I'll speak to her,\nAnd she shall be my queen.QHail, foreign wonder!\nWhom certain these rough shades did never breed,\nUnless the goddess that in rural shrine\nDwell'st here with Pan or Sylvan, by blest song\nForbidding every bleak unkindly fog\nTo touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood.\n         LADY. Nay, gentle shepherd, ill is lost that praise\nThat is addressed to unattending ears.\nNot any boast of skill, but extreme shift\nHow to regain my severed company,\nCompelled me to awake the courteous Echo\nTo give me answer from her mossy couch.\n         COMUS: What chance, good lady, hath bereft you thus?\n         LADY. Dim darkness and this leafy labyrinth.\n         COMUS. Could that divide you from near-ushering guides?\n         LADY. They left me weary on a grassy turf.\n         COMUS.

They were but twain, and purposed quick return.\n         COMUS. Perhaps forestalling night prevented them.\n         LADY. How easy my misfortune is to hit!\n         COMUS.

As smooth as Hebe's their unrazored lips.\n         COMUS. Two such I saw, what time the laboured ox\nIn his loose traces from the furrow came,\nAnd the swinked hedger at his supper sat.\nI saw them under a green mantling vine,\nThat crawls along the side of yon small hill,\nPlucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots;\nTheir port was more than human, as they stood.\nI took it for a faery vision\nOf some gay creatures of the element,\nThat in the colours of the rainbow live,\nAnd play i' the plighted clouds. I was awe-strook,\nAnd, as I passed, I worshiped. If those you seek,\nIt were a journey like the path to Heaven\nTo help you find them.\n         LADY.

'T is not vain or fabulous\n(Though so esteemed by shallow igrlorance)\nWhat the sage poets, taught by the heavenly Muse,\nStoried of old in high immortal verse\nOf dire Chimeras and enchanted isles,\nAnd rifted rocks whose entrance leads to Hell;\nFor such there be, but unbelief is blind.\n         Within the navel of this hideous wood,\nImmured in cypress shades, a sorcerer dwells,\nOf Bacchus and of Circe born, great Comus,\nDeep skilled in all his mother's witcheries,\nAnd here to every thirsty wanderer\nBy sly enticement gives his baneful cup,\nWith many murmurs mixed, whose pleasing poison\nThe visage quite transforms of him that drinks,\nAnd the inglorious likeness of a beast\nFixes instead, unmoulding reason's mintage\nCharactered in the face. This have I learnt\nTending my flocks hard by i' the hilly crofts\nThat brow this bottom glade; whence night by night\nHe and his monstrous rout are heard to howl\nLike stabled wolves, or tigers at their prey,\nDoing abhorred rites to Hecate\nIn their obscured haunts of inmost bowers.\nYet have they many baits and guileful spells\nTo inveigle and invite the unwary sense\nOf them that pass unweeting by the way.\nThis evening late, by then the chewing flocks\nHad ta'en their supper on the savoury herb\nOf knot-grass dew-besprent, and were in fold,\nI sat me down to watch upon a bank\nWith ivy canopied, and interwove\nWith flaunting honeysuckle, and began,\nWrapt in a pleasing fit of melancholy,\nTo meditate my rural minstrelsy,\nTill fancy had her fill. But ere a close\nThe wonted roar was up amidst the woods,\nAnd filled the air with barbarous dissonance;\nAt which I ceased, and listened them awhile,\nTill an unusual stop of sudden silence\nGave respite to the drowsy-flighted steeds\nThat draw the litter of close-curtained Sleep.\nAt last a soft and solemn-breathing sound\nRose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes,\nAnd stole upon the air, that even Silence\nWas took ere she was ware, and wished she might\nDeny her nature, and be never more,\nStill to be so displaced. I was all ear,\nAnd took in strains that might create a soul\nUnder the ribs of Death. But, oh! ere long\nToo well I did perceive it was the voice\nOf my most honoured Lady, your dear sister.\nAmazed I stood, harrowed with grief and fear;\nAnd RO poor hapless nightingale,\" thought I,\nHow sweet thou sing'st, how near the deadly snare!\"\nThen down the lawns I ran with headlong haste,\nThrough paths and turnings often trod by day,\nTill, guided by mine ear, I found the place\nWhere that damned wizard, hid in sly disguise\n(For so by certain signs I knew), had met\nAlready, ere my best speed could prevent,\nThe aidless innocent lady, his wished prey;\nWho gently asked if he had seen such two,\nSupposing him some neighbour villager.\nLonger I durst not stay, but soon I guessed\nYe were the two she meant; with that I sprung\nInto swift flight, till I had found you here;\nBut further know I not.\n         SEC. BRO.                   O night and shades,\nHow are ye joined with hell in triple knot\nAgainst the unarmed weakness of one virgin,\nAlone and helpless! Is this the confidence\nYou gave me, brother?\n         ELD. BRO.                   Yes, and keep it still;\nLean on it safely; not a period\nShall be unsaid for me. Against the threats\nOf malice or of sorcery, or that power\nWhich erring men call Chance, this I hold firm:\nVirtue may be assailed, but never hurt,\nSurprised by unjust force, but not enthralled;\nYea, even that which Mischief meant most harm\nShall in the happy trial prove most glory.\nBut evil on itself shall back recoil,\nAnd mix no more with goodness, when at last,\nGathered like scum, and settled to itself,\nIt shall be in eternal restless change\nSelf-fed and self-consumed. If this fail,\nThe pillared firmament is rottenness,\nAnd earth's base built on stubble. But come, let's on!\nAgainst the opposing will and arm of heaven\nMay never this just sword be lifted up;\nBut, for that damned magician, let him be girt\nWith all the griesly legions that troop\nUnder the sooty flag of Acheron,\nHarpies and Hydras, or all the monstrous forms\n'Twixt Africa and Ind, I'll find him out,\nAnd force him to return his purchase back,\nOr drag him by the curls to a foul death,\nCursed as his life.\n         SPIR.         Alas! good venturous youth,\nI love thy courage yet, and bold emprise;\nBut here thy sword can do thee little stead.\nFar other arms and other weapons must\nBe those that quell the might of hellish charms.\nHe with his bare wand can unthread thy joints,\nAnd crumble all thy sinews.\n         ELD. BRO.                            Why, prithee,\nShepherd,\nHow durst thou then thyself approach so near\nAs to make this relation?\n         SPIR.                                   Care and utmost\nshifts\nHow to secure the Lady from surprisal\nBrought to my mind a certain shepherd lad,\nOf small regard to see to, yet well skilled\nIn every virtuous plant and healing herb\nThat spreads her verdant leaf to the morning ray.\nHe loved me well, and oft would beg me sing;\nWhich when I did, he on the tender grass\nWould sit, and hearken even to ecstasy,\nAnd in requital ope his leathern scrip,\nAnd show me simples of a thousand names,\nTelling their strange and vigorous faculties.\nAmongst the rest a small unsightly root,\nBut of divine effect, he culled me out.\nThe leaf was darkish, and had prickles on it,\nBut in another country, as he said,\nBore a bright golden flower, but not in this soil:\nUnknown, and like esteemed, and the dull swain\nTreads on it daily with his clouted shoon;\nAnd yet more med'cinal is it than that Moly\nThat Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave.\nHe called it Haemony, and gave it me,\nAnd bade me keep it as of sovran use\n'Gainst all enchantments, mildew blast, or damp,\nOr ghastly Furies' apparition.\nI pursed it up, but little reckoning made,\nTill now that this extremity compelled.\nBut now I find it true; for by this means\nI knew the foul enchanter, though disguised,\nEntered the very lime-twigs of his spells,\nAnd yet came off. If you have this about you\n(As I will give you when we go), you may\nBoldly assault the necromancer's hall;\nWhere if he be, with dauntless hardihood\nAnd brandished blade rush on him: break his glass,\nAnd shed the luscious liquor on the ground;\nBut seize his wand. Though he and his curst crew\nFierce sign of battle make, and menace high,\nOr, like the sons of Vulcan, vomit smoke,\nYet will they soon retire, if he but shrink.\n         ELD. BRO. Thyrsis, lead on apace; I'll follow thee;\nAnd some good angel bear a shield before us!\n\nThe Scene changes to a stately palace, set out with all manner of\ndeliciousness: soft music, tables spread with all dainties. Comus\nappears with his rabble, and the LADY set in an enchanted chair;\nto\nwhom he offers his glass; which she puts by, and goes about to\nrise.\n\n         COMUS. Nay, Lady, sit. If I but wave this wand,\nYour nerves are all chained up in alabaster,\nAnd you a statue, or as Daphne was,\nRoot-bound, that fled Apollo.\n         LADY.                            Fool, do not boast.\nThou canst not touch the freedom of my mind\nWith all thy charms, although this corporal rind\nThou hast immanacled while Heaven sees good.\n         COMUS. Why are you vexed, Lady? why do you frown?\nHere dwell no frowns, nor anger; from these gates\nSorrow flies far. See, here be all the pleasures\nThat fancy can beget on youthful thoughts,\nWhen the fresh blood grows lively, and returns\nBrisk as the April buds in primrose season.\nAnd first behold this cordial julep here,\nThat flames and dances in his crystal bounds,\nWith spirits of balm and fragrant syrups mixed.\nNot that Nepenthes which the wife of Thone\nIn Egypt gave to Jove-born Helena\nIs of such power to stir up joy as this,\nTo life so friendly, or so cool to thirst.\nWhy should you be so cruel to yourself,\nAnd to those dainty limbs, which Nature lent\nFor gentle usage and soft delicacy?\nBut you invert the covenants of her trust,\nAnd harshly deal, like an ill borrower,\nWith that which you received on other terms,\nScorning the unexempt condition\nBy which all mortal frailty must subsist,\nRefreshment after toil, ease after pain,\nThat have been tired all day without repast,\nAnd timely rest have wanted. But, fair virgin,\nThis will restore all soon.\n         LADY.                         'T will not, false\ntraitor!\n'T will not restore the truth and honesty\nThat thou hast banished from thy tongue with lies.\nWas this the cottage and the safe abode\nThou told'st me of? What grim aspects are these,\nThese oughly-headed monsters? Mercy guard me!\nHence with thy brewed enchantments, foul deceiver!\nHast thou betrayed my credulous innocence\nWith vizored falsehood and base forgery?\nAnd would'st thou seek again to trap me here\nWith liquorish baits, fit to ensnare a brute?\nWere it a draught for Juno when she banquets,\nI would not taste thy treasonous offer. None\nBut such as are good men can give good things;\nAnd that which is not good is not delicious\nTo a well-governed and wise appetite.\n         COMUS. 0 foolishness of men! that lend their ears\nTo those budge doctors of the Stoic fur,\nAnd fetch their precepts from the Cynic tub,\nPraising the lean and sallow Abstinence!\nWherefore did Nature pour her bounties forth\nWith such a full and unwithdrawing hand,\nCovering the earth with odours, fruits, and flocks,\nThronging the seas with spawn innumerable,\nBut all to please and sate the curious taste?\nAnd set to work millions of spinning worms,\nThat in their green shops weave the smooth-haired silk,\nTo deck her sons; and, that no corner might\nBe vacant of her plenty, in her own loins\nShe hutched the all-worshipped ore and precious gems,\nTo store her children with. If all the world\nShould, in a pet of temperance, feed on pulse,\nDrink the clear stream, and nothing wear but frieze,\nThe All-giver would be unthanked, would be unpraised,\nNot half his riches known and yet despised;\nAnd we should serve him as a grudging master,\nAs a penurious niggard of his wealth,\nAnd live like Nature's bastards, not her sons,\nWho would be quite surcharged with her own weight,\nAnd strangled with her waste fertility:\nThe earth cumbered, and the winged air darked with plumes,\nThe herds would over-multitude their lords;\nThe sea o'erfraught would swell, and the unsought diamonds\nWould so emblaze the forehead of the deep,\nAnd so bestud with stars, that they below\nWould grow inured to light, and come at last\nTo gaze upon the sun with shameless brows.\nList, Lady; be not coy, and be not cozened\nWith that same vaunted name, Virginity.\nBeauty is Nature's coin; must not be hoarded,\nBut must be current; and the good thereof\nConsists in mutual and partaken bliss,\nUnsavoury in the enjoyment of itself.\nIf you let slip time, like a neglected rose\nIt withers on the stalk with languished head.\nBeauty is Nature's brag, and must be shown\nIn courts, at feasts, and high solemnities,\nWhere most may wonder at the workmanship.\nIt is for homely features to keep home;\nThey had their name thence: coarse complexions\nAnd cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply\nThe sampler, and to tease the huswife's wool.\nWhat need a vermeil-tinctured lip for that,\nLove-darting eyes, or tresses like the morn?\nThere was another meaning in these gifts;\nThink what, and be advised; you are but young yet.\n        LADY. I had not thought to have unlocked my lips\nIn this unhallowed air, but that this juggler\nWould think to charm my judgment, as mine eyes,\nObtruding false rules pranked in reason's garb.\nI hate when vice can bolt her arguments\nAnd virtue has no tongue to check her pride.\nImpostor! do not charge most innocent Nature,\nAs if she would her children should be riotous\nWith her abundance. She, good cateress,\nMeans her provision only to the good,\nThat live according to her sober laws,\nAnd holy dictate of spare Temperance.\nIf every just man that now pines with want\nHad but a moderate and beseeming share\nOf that which lewdly-pampered Luxury\nNow heaps upon some few with vast excess,\nNature's full blessings would be well dispensed\nIn unsuperfluous even proportion,\nAnd she no whit encumbered with her store;\nAnd then the Giver would be better thanked,\nHis praise due paid: for swinish gluttony\nNe'er looks to Heaven amidst his gorgeous feast,\nBut with besotted base ingratitude\nCrams, and blasphemes his Feeder. Shall I go on\nOr have I said enow? To him that dares\nArm his profane tongue with contemptuous words\nAgainst the sun-clad power of chastity\nFain would I something say;—yet to what end?\nThou hast nor ear, nor soul, to apprehend\nThe sublime notion and high mystery\nThat must be uttered to unfold the sage\nAnd serious doctrine of Virginity;\nAnd thou art worthy that thou shouldst not know\nMore happiness than this thy present lot.\nEnjoy your dear wit, and gay rhetoric,\nThat hath so well been taught her dazzling fence;\nThou art not fit to hear thyself convinced.\nYet, should I try, the uncontrolled worth\nOf this pure cause would kindle my rapt spirits\nTo such a flame of sacred vehemence\nThat dumb things would be moved to sympathise,\nAnd the brute Earth would lend her nerves, and shake,\nTill all thy magic structures, reared so high,\nWere shattered into heaps o'er thy false head.\n        COMUS. She fables not. I feel that I do fear\nHer words set off by some superior power;\nAnd, though not mortal, yet a cold shuddering dew\nDips me all o'er, as when the wrath of Jove\nSpeaks thunder and the chains of Erebus\nTo some of Saturn's crew. I must dissemble,\nAnd try her yet more strongly.—Come, no more !\nThis is mere moral babble, and direct\nAgainst the canon laws of our foundation.\nI must not suffer this; yet 't is but the lees\nAnd settlings of a melancholy blood.\nBut this will cure all straight; one sip of this\nWill bathe the drooping spirits in delight\nBeyond the bliss of dreams. Be wise, and taste.\n\nThe BROTHERS rush in with swords drawn, wrest his glass out of\nhis\nhand, and break it against the ground: his rout make sign of\nresistance, but are all driven in.

Without his rod reversed,\nAnd backward mutters of dissevering power,\nWe cannot free the Lady that sits here\nIn stony fetters fixed and motionless.\nYet stay: be not disturbed; now I bethink me,\nSome other means I have which may be used,\nWhich once of Meliboeus old I learnt,\nThe soothest shepherd that e'er piped on plains.\n         There is a gentle Nymph not far from hence,\nThat with moist curb sways the smooth Severn stream:\nSabrina is her name: a virgin pure;\nWhilom she was the daughter of Locrine,\nThat had the sceptre from his father Brute.\nShe, guiltless damsel, flying the mad pursuit\nOf her enraged stepdame, Guendolen,\nCommended her fair innocence to the flood\nThat stayed her flight with his cross-flowing course.\nThe water-nymphs, that in the bottom played,\nHeld up their pearled wrists, and took her in,\nBearing her straight to aged Nereus' hall;\nWho, piteous of her woes, reared her lank head,\nAnd gave her to his daughters to imbathe\nIn nectared lavers strewed with asphodil,\nAnd through the porch and inlet of each sense\nDropt in ambrosial oils, till she revived,\nAnd underwent a quick immortal change,\nMade Goddess of the river. Still she retains\nHer maiden gentleness, and oft at eve\nVisits the herds along the twilight meadows,\nHelping all urchin blasts, and ill-luck signs\nThat the shrewd meddling elf delights to make,\nWhich she with precious vialed liquors heals:\nFor which the shepherds, at their festivals,\nCarol her goodness loud in rustic lays,\nAnd throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream\nOf pansies, pinks, and gaudy daffodils.\nAnd, as the old swain said, she can unlock\nThe clasping charm, and thaw the numbing spell,\nIf she be right invoked in warbled song;\nFor maidenhood she loves, and will be swift\nTo aid a virgin, such as was herself,\nIn hard-besetting need. This will I try,\nAnd add the power of some adjuring verse.\n\n\nSONG.\n\n         Sabrina fair,\n                  Listen where thou art sitting\n         Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,\n                  In twisted braids of lilies knitting\n         The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair;\n                  Listen for dear honour's sake,\n         Goddess of the silver lake,\n                  Listen and save!\n\nListen, and appear to us,\nIn name of great Oceanus.\nBy the earth-shaking Neptune's mace,\nAnd Tethys' grave majestic pace;\nBy hoary Nereus' wrinkled look,\nAnd the Carpathian wizard's hook;\nBy scaly Triton's winding shell,\nAnd old soothsaying Glaucus' spell;\nBy Leucothea's lovely hands,\nAnd her son that rules the strands;\nBy Thetis' tinsel-slippered feet,\nAnd the songs of Sirens sweet;\nBy dead Parthenope's dear tomb,\nAnd fair Ligea's golden comb,\nWherewith she sits on diamond rocks\nSleeking her soft alluring locks;\nBy all the Nymphs that nightly dance\nUpon thy streams with wily glance;\nRise, rise, and heave thy rosy head\nFrom thy coral-paven bed,\nAnd bridle in thy headlong wave,\nTill thou our summons answered have.\n                                Listen and save!\n\nSABRINA rises, attended by water-nymphs, and sings.\n\nBy the rushy-fringed bank,\nWhere grows the willow and the osier dank,\n         My sliding chariot stays,\nThick set with agate, and the azurn sheen\nOf turkis blue, and emerald green,\n         That in the channel strays;\nWhilst from off the waters fleet\nThus I set my printless feet\nO'er the cowslip's velvet head,\n         That bends not as I tread.\nGentle swain, at thy request\n         I am here!\n\n         SPIR.

This patriarch blest,\nWhom faithful Abraham due time shall call,\nA son, and of his son a grand-child, leaves;\nLike him in faith, in wisdom, and renown:\nThe grandchild, with twelve sons increased, departs\nFrom Canaan to a land hereafter called\nEgypt, divided by the river Nile\nSee where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths\nInto the sea. To sojourn in that land\nHe comes, invited by a younger son\nIn time of dearth, a son whose worthy deeds\nRaise him to be the second in that realm\nOf Pharaoh. There he dies, and leaves his race\nGrowing into a nation, and now grown\nSuspected to a sequent king, who seeks\nTo stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests\nToo numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves\nInhospitably, and kills their infant males:\nTill by two brethren (these two brethren call\nMoses and Aaron) sent from God to claim\nHis people from enthralment, they return,\nWith glory and spoil, back to their promised land.\nBut first, the lawless tyrant, who denies\nTo know their God, or message to regard,\nMust be compelled by signs and judgements dire;\nTo blood unshed the rivers must be turned;\nFrogs, lice, and flies, must all his palace fill\nWith loathed intrusion, and fill all the land;\nHis cattle must of rot and murren die;\nBotches and blains must all his flesh emboss,\nAnd all his people; thunder mixed with hail,\nHail mixed with fire, must rend the Egyptians sky,\nAnd wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls;\nWhat it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain,\nA darksome cloud of locusts swarming down\nMust eat, and on the ground leave nothing green;\nDarkness must overshadow all his bounds,\nPalpable darkness, and blot out three days;\nLast, with one midnight stroke, all the first-born\nOf Egypt must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds\nThe river-dragon tamed at length submits\nTo let his sojourners depart, and oft\nHumbles his stubborn heart; but still, as ice\nMore hardened after thaw; till, in his rage\nPursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea\nSwallows him with his host; but them lets pass,\nAs on dry land, between two crystal walls;\nAwed by the rod of Moses so to stand\nDivided, till his rescued gain their shore:\nSuch wondrous power God to his saint will lend,\nThough present in his Angel; who shall go\nBefore them in a cloud, and pillar of fire;\nBy day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire;\nTo guide them in their journey, and remove\nBehind them, while the obdurate king pursues:\nAll night he will pursue; but his approach\nDarkness defends between till morning watch;\nThen through the fiery pillar, and the cloud,\nGod looking forth will trouble all his host,\nAnd craze their chariot-wheels: when by command\nMoses once more his potent rod extends\nOver the sea; the sea his rod obeys;\nOn their embattled ranks the waves return,\nAnd overwhelm their war:  The race elect\nSafe toward Canaan from the shore advance\nThrough the wild Desart, not the readiest way;\nLest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed,\nWar terrify them inexpert, and fear\nReturn them back to Egypt, choosing rather\nInglorious life with servitude; for life\nTo noble and ignoble is more sweet\nUntrained in arms, where rashness leads not on.\nThis also shall they gain by their delay\nIn the wide wilderness; there they shall found\nTheir government, and their great senate choose\nThrough the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained:\nGod from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top\nShall tremble, he descending, will himself\nIn thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets' sound,\nOrdain them laws; part, such as appertain\nTo civil justice; part, religious rites\nOf sacrifice; informing them, by types\nAnd shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise\nThe Serpent, by what means he shall achieve\nMankind's deliverance.  But the voice of God\nTo mortal ear is dreadful:  They beseech\nThat Moses might report to them his will,\nAnd terrour cease; he grants what they besought,\nInstructed that to God is no access\nWithout Mediator, whose high office now\nMoses in figure bears; to introduce\nOne greater, of whose day he shall foretel,\nAnd all the Prophets in their age the times\nOf great Messiah shall sing.  Thus, laws and rites\nEstablished, such delight hath God in Men\nObedient to his will, that he vouchsafes\nAmong them to set up his tabernacle;\nThe Holy One with mortal Men to dwell:\nBy his prescript a sanctuary is framed\nOf cedar, overlaid with gold; therein\nAn ark, and in the ark his testimony,\nThe records of his covenant; over these\nA mercy-seat of gold, between the wings\nOf two bright Cherubim; before him burn\nSeven lamps as in a zodiack representing\nThe heavenly fires; over the tent a cloud\nShall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night;\nSave when they journey, and at length they come,\nConducted by his Angel, to the land\nPromised to Abraham and his seed:--The rest\nWere long to tell; how many battles fought\nHow many kings destroyed; and kingdoms won;\nOr how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still\nA day entire, and night's due course adjourn,\nMan's voice commanding, 'Sun, in Gibeon stand,\n'And thou moon in the vale of Aialon,\n'Till Israel overcome! so call the third\nFrom Abraham, son of Isaac; and from him\nHis whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.\nHere Adam interposed.  O sent from Heaven,\nEnlightener of my darkness, gracious things\nThou hast revealed; those chiefly, which concern\nJust Abraham and his seed: now first I find\nMine eyes true-opening, and my heart much eased;\nErewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become\nOf me and all mankind:  But now I see\nHis day, in whom all nations shall be blest;\nFavour unmerited by me, who sought\nForbidden knowledge by forbidden means.\nThis yet I apprehend not, why to those\nAmong whom God will deign to dwell on earth\nSo many and so various laws are given;\nSo many laws argue so many sins\nAmong them; how can God with such reside?\nTo whom thus Michael.  Doubt not but that sin\nWill reign among them, as of thee begot;\nAnd therefore was law given them, to evince\nTheir natural pravity, by stirring up\nSin against law to fight: that when they see\nLaw can discover sin, but not remove,\nSave by those shadowy expiations weak,\nThe blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude\nSome blood more precious must be paid for Man;\nJust for unjust; that, in such righteousness\nTo them by faith imputed, they may find\nJustification towards God, and peace\nOf conscience; which the law by ceremonies\nCannot appease; nor Man the mortal part\nPerform; and, not performing, cannot live.\nSo law appears imperfect; and but given\nWith purpose to resign them, in full time,\nUp to a better covenant; disciplined\nFrom shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit;\nFrom imposition of strict laws to free\nAcceptance of large grace; from servile fear\nTo filial; works of law to works of faith.\nAnd therefore shall not Moses, though of God\nHighly beloved, being but the minister\nOf law, his people into Canaan lead;\nBut Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call,\nHis name and office bearing, who shall quell\nThe adversary-Serpent, and bring back\nThrough the world's wilderness long-wandered Man\nSafe to eternal Paradise of rest.\nMean while they, in their earthly Canaan placed,\nLong time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins\nNational interrupt their publick peace,\nProvoking God to raise them enemies;\nFrom whom as oft he saves them penitent\nBy Judges first, then under Kings; of whom\nThe second, both for piety renowned\nAnd puissant deeds, a promise shall receive\nIrrevocable, that his regal throne\nFor ever shall endure; the like shall sing\nAll Prophecy, that of the royal stock\nOf David (so I name this king) shall rise\nA Son, the Woman's seed to thee foretold,\nForetold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust\nAll nations; and to kings foretold, of kings\nThe last; for of his reign shall be no end.\nBut first, a long succession must ensue;\nAnd his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed,\nThe clouded ark of God, till then in tents\nWandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine.\nSuch follow him, as shall be registered\nPart good, part bad; of bad the longer scroll;\nWhose foul idolatries, and other faults\nHeaped to the popular sum, will so incense\nGod, as to leave them, and expose their land,\nTheir city, his temple, and his holy ark,\nWith all his sacred things, a scorn and prey\nTo that proud city, whose high walls thou sawest\nLeft in confusion; Babylon thence called.\nThere in captivity he lets them dwell\nThe space of seventy years; then brings them back,\nRemembering mercy, and his covenant sworn\nTo David, stablished as the days of Heaven.\nReturned from Babylon by leave of kings\nTheir lords, whom God disposed, the house of God\nThey first re-edify; and for a while\nIn mean estate live moderate; till, grown\nIn wealth and multitude, factious they grow;\nBut first among the priests dissention springs,\nMen who attend the altar, and should most\nEndeavour peace: their strife pollution brings\nUpon the temple itself: at last they seise\nThe scepter, and regard not David's sons;\nThen lose it to a stranger, that the true\nAnointed King Messiah might be born\nBarred of his right; yet at his birth a star,\nUnseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come;\nAnd guides the eastern sages, who inquire\nHis place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold:\nHis place of birth a solemn Angel tells\nTo simple shepherds, keeping watch by night;\nThey gladly thither haste, and by a quire\nOf squadroned Angels hear his carol sung.\nA virgin is his mother, but his sire\nThe power of the Most High:  He shall ascend\nThe throne hereditary, and bound his reign\nWith Earth's wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens.\nHe ceased, discerning Adam with such joy\nSurcharged, as had like grief been dewed in tears,\nWithout the vent of words; which these he breathed.\nO prophet of glad tidings, finisher\nOf utmost hope! now clear I understand\nWhat oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain;\nWhy our great Expectation should be called\nThe seed of Woman:  Virgin Mother, hail,\nHigh in the love of Heaven; yet from my loins\nThou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the Son\nOf God Most High: so God with Man unites!\nNeeds must the Serpent now his capital bruise\nExpect with mortal pain:  Say where and when\nTheir fight, what stroke shall bruise the victor's heel.\nTo whom thus Michael.  Dream not of their fight,\nAs of a duel, or the local wounds\nOf head or heel:  Not therefore joins the Son\nManhood to Godhead, with more strength to foil\nThy enemy; nor so is overcome\nSatan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise,\nDisabled, not to give thee thy death's wound:\nWhich he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,\nNot by destroying Satan, but his works\nIn thee, and in thy seed:  Nor can this be,\nBut by fulfilling that which thou didst want,\nObedience to the law of God, imposed\nOn penalty of death, and suffering death;\nThe penalty to thy transgression due,\nAnd due to theirs which out of thine will grow:\nSo only can high Justice rest appaid.\nThe law of God exact he shall fulfil\nBoth by obedience and by love, though love\nAlone fulfil the law; thy punishment\nHe shall endure, by coming in the flesh\nTo a reproachful life, and cursed death;\nProclaiming life to all who shall believe\nIn his redemption; and that his obedience,\nImputed, becomes theirs by faith; his merits\nTo save them, not their own, though legal, works.\nFor this he shall live hated, be blasphemed,\nSeised on by force, judged, and to death condemned\nA shameful and accursed, nailed to the cross\nBy his own nation; slain for bringing life:\nBut to the cross he nails thy enemies,\nThe law that is against thee, and the sins\nOf all mankind, with him there crucified,\nNever to hurt them more who rightly trust\nIn this his satisfaction; so he dies,\nBut soon revives; Death over him no power\nShall long usurp; ere the third dawning light\nReturn, the stars of morn shall see him rise\nOut of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,\nThy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,\nHis death for Man, as many as offered life\nNeglect not, and the benefit embrace\nBy faith not void of works:  This God-like act\nAnnuls thy doom, the death thou shouldest have died,\nIn sin for ever lost from life; this act\nShall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength,\nDefeating Sin and Death, his two main arms;\nAnd fix far deeper in his head their stings\nThan temporal death shall bruise the victor's heel,\nOr theirs whom he redeems; a death, like sleep,\nA gentle wafting to immortal life.\nNor after resurrection shall he stay\nLonger on earth, than certain times to appear\nTo his disciples, men who in his life\nStill followed him; to them shall leave in charge\nTo teach all nations what of him they learned\nAnd his salvation; them who shall believe\nBaptizing in the profluent stream, the sign\nOf washing them from guilt of sin to life\nPure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,\nFor death, like that which the Redeemer died.\nAll nations they shall teach; for, from that day,\nNot only to the sons of Abraham's loins\nSalvation shall be preached, but to the sons\nOf Abraham's faith wherever through the world;\nSo in his seed all nations shall be blest.\nThen to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend\nWith victory, triumphing through the air\nOver his foes and thine; there shall surprise\nThe Serpent, prince of air, and drag in chains\nThrough all his realm, and there confounded leave;\nThen enter into glory, and resume\nHis seat at God's right hand, exalted high\nAbove all names in Heaven; and thence shall come,\nWhen this world's dissolution shall be ripe,\nWith glory and power to judge both quick and dead;\nTo judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward\nHis faithful, and receive them into bliss,\nWhether in Heaven or Earth; for then the Earth\nShall all be Paradise, far happier place\nThan this of Eden, and far happier days.\nSo spake the Arch-Angel Michael; then paused,\nAs at the world's great period; and our sire,\nReplete with joy and wonder, thus replied.\nO Goodness infinite, Goodness immense!\nThat all this good of evil shall produce,\nAnd evil turn to good; more wonderful\nThan that which by creation first brought forth\nLight out of darkness!  Full of doubt I stand,\nWhether I should repent me now of sin\nBy me done, and occasioned; or rejoice\nMuch more, that much more good thereof shall spring;\nTo God more glory, more good-will to Men\nFrom God, and over wrath grace shall abound.\nBut say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven\nMust re-ascend, what will betide the few\nHis faithful, left among the unfaithful herd,\nThe enemies of truth?  Who then shall guide\nHis people, who defend?  Will they not deal\nWorse with his followers than with him they dealt?\nBe sure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven\nHe to his own a Comforter will send,\nThe promise of the Father, who shall dwell\nHis Spirit within them; and the law of faith,\nWorking through love, upon their hearts shall write,\nTo guide them in all truth; and also arm\nWith spiritual armour, able to resist\nSatan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts;\nWhat man can do against them, not afraid,\nThough to the death; against such cruelties\nWith inward consolations recompensed,\nAnd oft supported so as shall amaze\nTheir proudest persecutors:  For the Spirit,\nPoured first on his Apostles, whom he sends\nTo evangelize the nations, then on all\nBaptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue\nTo speak all tongues, and do all miracles,\nAs did their Lord before them.  Thus they win\nGreat numbers of each nation to receive\nWith joy the tidings brought from Heaven:  At length\nTheir ministry performed, and race well run,\nTheir doctrine and their story written left,\nThey die; but in their room, as they forewarn,\nWolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves,\nWho all the sacred mysteries of Heaven\nTo their own vile advantages shall turn\nOf lucre and ambition; and the truth\nWith superstitions and traditions taint,\nLeft only in those written records pure,\nThough not but by the Spirit understood.\nThen shall they seek to avail themselves of names,\nPlaces, and titles, and with these to join\nSecular power; though feigning still to act\nBy spiritual, to themselves appropriating\nThe Spirit of God, promised alike and given\nTo all believers; and, from that pretence,\nSpiritual laws by carnal power shall force\nOn every conscience; laws which none shall find\nLeft them inrolled, or what the Spirit within\nShall on the heart engrave.  What will they then\nBut force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind\nHis consort Liberty? what, but unbuild\nHis living temples, built by faith to stand,\nTheir own faith, not another's? for, on earth,\nWho against faith and conscience can be heard\nInfallible? yet many will presume:\nWhence heavy persecution shall arise\nOn all, who in the worship persevere\nOf spirit and truth; the rest, far greater part,\nWill deem in outward rites and specious forms\nReligion satisfied; Truth shall retire\nBestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith\nRarely be found:  So shall the world go on,\nTo good malignant, to bad men benign;\nUnder her own weight groaning; till the day\nAppear of respiration to the just,\nAnd vengeance to the wicked, at return\nOf him so lately promised to thy aid,\nThe Woman's Seed; obscurely then foretold,\nNow ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord;\nLast, in the clouds, from Heaven to be revealed\nIn glory of the Father, to dissolve\nSatan with his perverted world; then raise\nFrom the conflagrant mass, purged and refined,\nNew Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date,\nFounded in righteousness, and peace, and love;\nTo bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss.\nHe ended; and thus Adam last replied.\nHow soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,\nMeasured this transient world, the race of time,\nTill time stand fixed!  Beyond is all abyss,\nEternity, whose end no eye can reach.\nGreatly-instructed I shall hence depart;\nGreatly in peace of thought; and have my fill\nOf knowledge, what this vessel can contain;\nBeyond which was my folly to aspire.\nHenceforth I learn, that to obey is best,\nAnd love with fear the only God; to walk\nAs in his presence; ever to observe\nHis providence; and on him sole depend,\nMerciful over all his works, with good\nStill overcoming evil, and by small\nAccomplishing great things, by things deemed weak\nSubverting worldly strong, and worldly wise\nBy simply meek: that suffering for truth's sake\nIs fortitude to highest victory,\nAnd, to the faithful, death the gate of life;\nTaught this by his example, whom I now\nAcknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.\nTo whom thus also the Angel last replied.\nThis having learned, thou hast attained the sum\nOf wisdom; hope no higher, though all the stars\nThou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers,\nAll secrets of the deep, all Nature's works,\nOr works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea,\nAnd all the riches of this world enjoyedst,\nAnd all the rule, one empire; only add\nDeeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith,\nAdd virtue, patience, temperance; add love,\nBy name to come called charity, the soul\nOf all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth\nTo leave this Paradise, but shalt possess\nA Paradise within thee, happier far.--\nLet us descend now therefore from this top\nOf speculation; for the hour precise\nExacts our parting hence; and see!the guards,\nBy me encamped on yonder hill, expect\nTheir motion; at whose front a flaming sword,\nIn signal of remove, waves fiercely round:\nWe may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;\nHer also I with gentle dreams have calmed\nPortending good, and all her spirits composed\nTo meek submission: thou, at season fit,\nLet her with thee partake what thou hast heard;\nChiefly what may concern her faith to know,\nThe great deliverance by her seed to come\n(For by the Woman's seed) on all mankind:\nThat ye may live, which will be many days,\nBoth in one faith unanimous, though sad,\nWith cause, for evils past; yet much more cheered\nWith meditation on the happy end.\nHe ended, and they both descend the hill;\nDescended, Adam to the bower, where Eve\nLay sleeping, ran before; but found her waked;\nAnd thus with words not sad she him received.\nWhence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know;\nFor God is also in sleep; and dreams advise,\nWhich he hath sent propitious, some great good\nPresaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress\nWearied I fell asleep:  But now lead on;\nIn me is no delay; with thee to go,\nIs to stay here; without thee here to stay,\nIs to go hence unwilling; thou to me\nArt all things under $Heaven, all places thou,\nWho for my wilful crime art banished hence.\nThis further consolation yet secure\nI carry hence; though all by me is lost,\nSuch favour I unworthy am vouchsafed,\nBy me the Promised Seed shall all restore.\nSo spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard\nWell pleased, but answered not:  For now, too nigh\nThe Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill\nTo their fixed station, all in bright array\nThe Cherubim descended; on the ground\nGliding meteorous, as evening-mist\nRisen from a river o'er the marish glides,\nAnd gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel\nHomeward returning.  High in front advanced,\nThe brandished sword of God before them blazed,\nFierce as a comet; which with torrid heat,\nAnd vapour as the Libyan air adust,\nBegan to parch that temperate clime; whereat\nIn either hand the hastening Angel caught\nOur lingering parents, and to the eastern gate\nLed them direct, and down the cliff as fast\nTo the subjected plain; then disappeared.\nThey, looking back, all the eastern side beheld\nOf Paradise, so late their happy seat,\nWaved over by that flaming brand; the gate\nWith dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms:\nSome natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon;\nThe world was all before them, where to choose\nTheir place of rest, and Providence their guide:\nThey, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,\nThrough Eden took their solitary way.\n\n\nTHE END","title":"Paradise Lost: Book 12"},{"lines":"The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear\nSo charming left his voice, that he a while\nThought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear;\nThen, as new waked, thus gratefully replied.\nWhat thanks sufficient, or what recompence\nEqual, have I to render thee, divine\nHistorian, who thus largely hast allayed\nThe thirst I had of knowledge, and vouchsafed\nThis friendly condescension to relate\nThings, else by me unsearchable; now heard\nWith wonder, but delight, and, as is due,\nWith glory attributed to the high\nCreator!  Something yet of doubt remains,\nWhich only thy solution can resolve.\nWhen I behold this goodly frame, this world,\nOf Heaven and Earth consisting; and compute\nTheir magnitudes; this Earth, a spot, a grain,\nAn atom, with the firmament compared\nAnd all her numbered stars, that seem to roll\nSpaces incomprehensible, (for such\nTheir distance argues, and their swift return\nDiurnal,) merely to officiate light\nRound this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,\nOne day and night; in all her vast survey\nUseless besides; reasoning I oft admire,\nHow Nature wise and frugal could commit\nSuch disproportions, with superfluous hand\nSo many nobler bodies to create,\nGreater so manifold, to this one use,\nFor aught appears, and on their orbs impose\nSuch restless revolution day by day\nRepeated; while the sedentary Earth,\nThat better might with far less compass move,\nServed by more noble than herself, attains\nHer end without least motion, and receives,\nAs tribute, such a sumless journey brought\nOf incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;\nSpeed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.\nSo spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed\nEntering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve\nPerceiving, where she sat retired in sight,\nWith lowliness majestick from her seat,\nAnd grace that won who saw to wish her stay,\nRose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers,\nTo visit how they prospered, bud and bloom,\nHer nursery; they at her coming sprung,\nAnd, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.\nYet went she not, as not with such discourse\nDelighted, or not capable her ear\nOf what was high: such pleasure she reserved,\nAdam relating, she sole auditress;\nHer husband the relater she preferred\nBefore the Angel, and of him to ask\nChose rather; he, she knew, would intermix\nGrateful digressions, and solve high dispute\nWith conjugal caresses: from his lip\nNot words alone pleased her.  O! when meet now\nSuch pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?\nWith Goddess-like demeanour forth she went,\nNot unattended; for on her, as Queen,\nA pomp of winning Graces waited still,\nAnd from about her shot darts of desire\nInto all eyes, to wish her still in sight.\nAnd Raphael now, to Adam's doubt proposed,\nBenevolent and facile thus replied.\nTo ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven\nIs as the book of God before thee set,\nWherein to read his wonderous works, and learn\nHis seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years:\nThis to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth,\nImports not, if thou reckon right; the rest\nFrom Man or Angel the great Architect\nDid wisely to conceal, and not divulge\nHis secrets to be scanned by them who ought\nRather admire; or, if they list to try\nConjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens\nHath left to their disputes, perhaps to move\nHis laughter at their quaint opinions wide\nHereafter; when they come to model Heaven\nAnd calculate the stars, how they will wield\nThe mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive\nTo save appearances; how gird the sphere\nWith centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er,\nCycle and epicycle, orb in orb:\nAlready by thy reasoning this I guess,\nWho art to lead thy offspring, and supposest\nThat bodies bright and greater should not serve\nThe less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,\nEarth sitting still, when she alone receives\nThe benefit:  Consider first, that great\nOr bright infers not excellence: the Earth\nThough, in comparison of Heaven, so small,\nNor glistering, may of solid good contain\nMore plenty than the sun that barren shines;\nWhose virtue on itself works no effect,\nBut in the fruitful Earth; there first received,\nHis beams, unactive else, their vigour find.\nYet not to Earth are those bright luminaries\nOfficious; but to thee, Earth's habitant.\nAnd for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak\nThe Maker's high magnificence, who built\nSo spacious, and his line stretched out so far;\nThat Man may know he dwells not in his own;\nAn edifice too large for him to fill,\nLodged in a small partition; and the rest\nOrdained for uses to his Lord best known.\nThe swiftness of those circles attribute,\nThough numberless, to his Omnipotence,\nThat to corporeal substances could add\nSpeed almost spiritual:  Me thou thinkest not slow,\nWho since the morning-hour set out from Heaven\nWhere God resides, and ere mid-day arrived\nIn Eden; distance inexpressible\nBy numbers that have name.  But this I urge,\nAdmitting motion in the Heavens, to show\nInvalid that which thee to doubt it moved;\nNot that I so affirm, though so it seem\nTo thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.\nGod, to remove his ways from human sense,\nPlaced Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,\nIf it presume, might err in things too high,\nAnd no advantage gain.  What if the sun\nBe center to the world; and other stars,\nBy his attractive virtue and their own\nIncited, dance about him various rounds?\nTheir wandering course now high, now low, then hid,\nProgressive, retrograde, or standing still,\nIn six thou seest; and what if seventh to these\nThe planet earth, so stedfast though she seem,\nInsensibly three different motions move?\nWhich else to several spheres thou must ascribe,\nMoved contrary with thwart obliquities;\nOr save the sun his labour, and that swift\nNocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed,\nInvisible else above all stars, the wheel\nOf day and night; which needs not thy belief,\nIf earth, industrious of herself, fetch day\nTravelling east, and with her part averse\nFrom the sun's beam meet night, her other part\nStill luminous by his ray.  What if that light,\nSent from her through the wide transpicuous air,\nTo the terrestrial moon be as a star,\nEnlightening her by day, as she by night\nThis earth? reciprocal, if land be there,\nFields and inhabitants:  Her spots thou seest\nAs clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce\nFruits in her softened soil for some to eat\nAllotted there; and other suns perhaps,\nWith their attendant moons, thou wilt descry,\nCommunicating male and female light;\nWhich two great sexes animate the world,\nStored in each orb perhaps with some that live.\nFor such vast room in Nature unpossessed\nBy living soul, desart and desolate,\nOnly to shine, yet scarce to contribute\nEach orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far\nDown to this habitable, which returns\nLight back to them, is obvious to dispute.\nBut whether thus these things, or whether not;\nBut whether the sun, predominant in Heaven,\nRise on the earth; or earth rise on the sun;\nHe from the east his flaming road begin;\nOr she from west her silent course advance,\nWith inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps\nOn her soft axle, while she paces even,\nAnd bears thee soft with the smooth hair along;\nSollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid;\nLeave them to God above; him serve, and fear!\nOf other creatures, as him pleases best,\nWherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou\nIn what he gives to thee, this Paradise\nAnd thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high\nTo know what passes there; be lowly wise:\nThink only what concerns thee, and thy being;\nDream not of other worlds, what creatures there\nLive, in what state, condition, or degree;\nContented that thus far hath been revealed\nNot of Earth only, but of highest Heaven.\nTo whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied.\nHow fully hast thou satisfied me, pure\nIntelligence of Heaven, Angel serene!\nAnd, freed from intricacies, taught to live\nThe easiest way; nor with perplexing thoughts\nTo interrupt the sweet of life, from which\nGod hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares,\nAnd not molest us; unless we ourselves\nSeek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain.\nBut apt the mind or fancy is to rove\nUnchecked, and of her roving is no end;\nTill warned, or by experience taught, she learn,\nThat, not to know at large of things remote\nFrom use, obscure and subtle; but, to know\nThat which before us lies in daily life,\nIs the prime wisdom:  What is more, is fume,\nOr emptiness, or fond impertinence:\nAnd renders us, in things that most concern,\nUnpractised, unprepared, and still to seek.\nTherefore from this high pitch let us descend\nA lower flight, and speak of things at hand\nUseful; whence, haply, mention may arise\nOf something not unseasonable to ask,\nBy sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned.\nThee I have heard relating what was done\nEre my remembrance: now, hear me relate\nMy story, which perhaps thou hast not heard;\nAnd day is not yet spent; till then thou seest\nHow subtly to detain thee I devise;\nInviting thee to hear while I relate;\nFond! were it not in hope of thy reply:\nFor, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven;\nAnd sweeter thy discourse is to my ear\nThan fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst\nAnd hunger both, from labour, at the hour\nOf sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,\nThough pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine\nImbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety.\nTo whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek.\nNor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,\nNor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee\nAbundantly his gifts hath also poured\nInward and outward both, his image fair:\nSpeaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace\nAttends thee; and each word, each motion, forms;\nNor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth\nThan of our fellow-servant, and inquire\nGladly into the ways of God with Man:\nFor God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set\nOn Man his equal love:  Say therefore on;\nFor I that day was absent, as befel,\nBound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,\nFar on excursion toward the gates of Hell;\nSquared in full legion (such command we had)\nTo see that none thence issued forth a spy,\nOr enemy, while God was in his work;\nLest he, incensed at such eruption bold,\nDestruction with creation might have mixed.\nNot that they durst without his leave attempt;\nBut us he sends upon his high behests\nFor state, as Sovran King; and to inure\nOur prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut,\nThe dismal gates, and barricadoed strong;\nBut long ere our approaching heard within\nNoise, other than the sound of dance or song,\nTorment, and loud lament, and furious rage.\nGlad we returned up to the coasts of light\nEre sabbath-evening: so we had in charge.\nBut thy relation now; for I attend,\nPleased with thy words no less than thou with mine.\nSo spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.\nFor Man to tell how human life began\nIs hard; for who himself beginning knew\nDesire with thee still longer to converse\nInduced me.  As new waked from soundest sleep,\nSoft on the flowery herb I found me laid,\nIn balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun\nSoon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.\nStraight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned,\nAnd gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised\nBy quick instinctive motion, up I sprung,\nAs thitherward endeavouring, and upright\nStood on my feet: about me round I saw\nHill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,\nAnd liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these,\nCreatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew;\nBirds on the branches warbling; all things smiled;\nWith fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed.\nMyself I then perused, and limb by limb\nSurveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran\nWith supple joints, as lively vigour led:\nBut who I was, or where, or from what cause,\nKnew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake;\nMy tongue obeyed, and readily could name\nWhate'er I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, fair light,\nAnd thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay,\nYe Hills, and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains,\nAnd ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,\nTell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here?--\nNot of myself;--by some great Maker then,\nIn goodness and in power pre-eminent:\nTell me, how may I know him, how adore,\nFrom whom I have that thus I move and live,\nAnd feel that I am happier than I know.--\nWhile thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither,\nFrom where I first drew air, and first beheld\nThis happy light; when, answer none returned,\nOn a green shady bank, profuse of flowers,\nPensive I sat me down:  There gentle sleep\nFirst found me, and with soft oppression seised\nMy droused sense, untroubled, though I thought\nI then was passing to my former state\nInsensible, and forthwith to dissolve:\nWhen suddenly stood at my head a dream,\nWhose inward apparition gently moved\nMy fancy to believe I yet had being,\nAnd lived:  One came, methought, of shape divine,\nAnd said, 'Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise,\n'First Man, of men innumerable ordained\n'First Father! called by thee, I come thy guide\n'To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.'\nSo saying, by the hand he took me raised,\nAnd over fields and waters, as in air\nSmooth-sliding without step, last led me up\nA woody mountain; whose high top was plain,\nA circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees\nPlanted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw\nOf Earth before scarce pleasant seemed.  Each tree,\nLoaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye\nTempting, stirred in me sudden appetite\nTo pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found\nBefore mine eyes all real, as the dream\nHad lively shadowed:  Here had new begun\nMy wandering, had not he, who was my guide\nUp hither, from among the trees appeared,\nPresence Divine.  Rejoicing, but with awe,\nIn adoration at his feet I fell\nSubmiss:  He reared me, and 'Whom thou soughtest I am,'\nSaid mildly, 'Author of all this thou seest\n'Above, or round about thee, or beneath.\n'This Paradise I give thee, count it thine\n'To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat:\n'Of every tree that in the garden grows\n'Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:\n'But of the tree whose operation brings\n'Knowledge of good and ill, which I have set\n'The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith,\n'Amid the garden by the tree of life,\n'Remember what I warn thee, shun to taste,\n'And shun the bitter consequence: for know,\n'The day thou eatest thereof, my sole command\n'Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die,\n'From that day mortal; and this happy state\n'Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world\n'Of woe and sorrow.'  Sternly he pronounced\nThe rigid interdiction, which resounds\nYet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice\nNot to incur; but soon his clear aspect\nReturned, and gracious purpose thus renewed.\n'Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth\n'To thee and to thy race I give; as lords\n'Possess it, and all things that therein live,\n'Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl.\n'In sign whereof, each bird and beast behold\n'After their kinds; I bring them to receive\n'From thee their names, and pay thee fealty\n'With low subjection; understand the same\n'Of fish within their watery residence,\n'Not hither summoned, since they cannot change\n'Their element, to draw the thinner air.'\nAs thus he spake, each bird and beast behold\nApproaching two and two; these cowering low\nWith blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing.\nI named them, as they passed, and understood\nTheir nature, with such knowledge God endued\nMy sudden apprehension:  But in these\nI found not what methought I wanted still;\nAnd to the heavenly Vision thus presumed.\nO, by what name, for thou above all these,\nAbove mankind, or aught than mankind higher,\nSurpassest far my naming; how may I\nAdore thee, Author of this universe,\nAnd all this good to man? for whose well being\nSo amply, and with hands so liberal,\nThou hast provided all things:  But with me\nI see not who partakes.  In solitude\nWhat happiness, who can enjoy alone,\nOr, all enjoying, what contentment find?\nThus I presumptuous; and the Vision bright,\nAs with a smile more brightened, thus replied.\nWhat callest thou solitude?  Is not the Earth\nWith various living creatures, and the air\nReplenished, and all these at thy command\nTo come and play before thee?  Knowest thou not\nTheir language and their ways?  They also know,\nAnd reason not contemptibly:  With these\nFind pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.\nSo spake the Universal Lord, and seemed\nSo ordering:  I, with leave of speech implored,\nAnd humble deprecation, thus replied.\nLet not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power;\nMy Maker, be propitious while I speak.\nHast thou not made me here thy substitute,\nAnd these inferiour far beneath me set?\nAmong unequals what society\nCan sort, what harmony, or true delight?\nWhich must be mutual, in proportion due\nGiven and received; but, in disparity\nThe one intense, the other still remiss,\nCannot well suit with either, but soon prove\nTedious alike:  Of fellowship I speak\nSuch as I seek, fit to participate\nAll rational delight: wherein the brute\nCannot be human consort:  They rejoice\nEach with their kind, lion with lioness;\nSo fitly them in pairs thou hast combined:\nMuch less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl\nSo well converse, nor with the ox the ape;\nWorse then can man with beast, and least of all.\nWhereto the Almighty answered, not displeased.\nA nice and subtle happiness, I see,\nThou to thyself proposest, in the choice\nOf thy associates, Adam! and wilt taste\nNo pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.\nWhat thinkest thou then of me, and this my state?\nSeem I to thee sufficiently possessed\nOf happiness, or not? who am alone\nFrom all eternity; for none I know\nSecond to me or like, equal much less.\nHow have I then with whom to hold converse,\nSave with the creatures which I made, and those\nTo me inferiour, infinite descents\nBeneath what other creatures are to thee?\nHe ceased; I lowly answered.  To attain\nThe highth and depth of thy eternal ways\nAll human thoughts come short, Supreme of things!\nThou in thyself art perfect, and in thee\nIs no deficience found:  Not so is Man,\nBut in degree; the cause of his desire\nBy conversation with his like to help\nOr solace his defects.  No need that thou\nShouldst propagate, already Infinite;\nAnd through all numbers absolute, though One:\nBut Man by number is to manifest\nHis single imperfection, and beget\nLike of his like, his image multiplied,\nIn unity defective; which requires\nCollateral love, and dearest amity.\nThou in thy secresy although alone,\nBest with thyself accompanied, seekest not\nSocial communication; yet, so pleased,\nCanst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt\nOf union or communion, deified:\nI, by conversing, cannot these erect\nFrom prone; nor in their ways complacence find.\nThus I emboldened spake, and freedom used\nPermissive, and acceptance found; which gained\nThis answer from the gracious Voice Divine.\nThus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased;\nAnd find thee knowing, not of beasts alone,\nWhich thou hast rightly named, but of thyself;\nExpressing well the spirit within thee free,\nMy image, not imparted to the brute;\nWhose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee\nGood reason was thou freely shouldst dislike;\nAnd be so minded still:  I, ere thou spakest,\nKnew it not good for Man to be alone;\nAnd no such company as then thou sawest\nIntended thee; for trial only brought,\nTo see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet:\nWhat next I bring shall please thee, be assured,\nThy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,\nThy wish exactly to thy heart's desire.\nHe ended, or I heard no more; for now\nMy earthly by his heavenly overpowered,\nWhich it had long stood under, strained to the highth\nIn that celestial colloquy sublime,\nAs with an object that excels the sense\nDazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair\nOf sleep, which instantly fell on me, called\nBy Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes.\nMine eyes he closed, but open left the cell\nOf fancy, my internal sight; by which,\nAbstract as in a trance, methought I saw,\nThough sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape\nStill glorious before whom awake I stood:\nWho stooping opened my left side, and took\nFrom thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm,\nAnd life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,\nBut suddenly with flesh filled up and healed:\nThe rib he formed and fashioned with his hands;\nUnder his forming hands a creature grew,\nMan-like, but different sex; so lovely fair,\nThat what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now\nMean, or in her summed up, in her contained\nAnd in her looks; which from that time infused\nSweetness into my heart, unfelt before,\nAnd into all things from her air inspired\nThe spirit of love and amorous delight.\nShe disappeared, and left me dark; I waked\nTo find her, or for ever to deplore\nHer loss, and other pleasures all abjure:\nWhen out of hope, behold her, not far off,\nSuch as I saw her in my dream, adorned\nWith what all Earth or Heaven could bestow\nTo make her amiable:  On she came,\nLed by her heavenly Maker, though unseen,\nAnd guided by his voice; nor uninformed\nOf nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites:\nGrace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye,\nIn every gesture dignity and love.\nI, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud.\nThis turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled\nThy words, Creator bounteous and benign,\nGiver of all things fair! but fairest this\nOf all thy gifts! nor enviest.  I now see\nBone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself\nBefore me:  Woman is her name;of Man\nExtracted: for this cause he shall forego\nFather and mother, and to his wife adhere;\nAnd they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.\nShe heard me thus; and though divinely brought,\nYet innocence, and virgin modesty,\nHer virtue, and the conscience of her worth,\nThat would be wooed, and not unsought be won,\nNot obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired,\nThe more desirable; or, to say all,\nNature herself, though pure of sinful thought,\nWrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned:\nI followed her; she what was honour knew,\nAnd with obsequious majesty approved\nMy pleaded reason.  To the nuptial bower\nI led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven,\nAnd happy constellations, on that hour\nShed their selectest influence; the Earth\nGave sign of gratulation, and each hill;\nJoyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs\nWhispered it to the woods, and from their wings\nFlung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub,\nDisporting, till the amorous bird of night\nSung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star\nOn his hill top, to light the bridal lamp.\nThus have I told thee all my state, and brought\nMy story to the sum of earthly bliss,\nWhich I enjoy; and must confess to find\nIn all things else delight indeed, but such\nAs, used or not, works in the mind no change,\nNor vehement desire; these delicacies\nI mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers,\nWalks, and the melody of birds: but here\nFar otherwise, transported I behold,\nTransported touch; here passion first I felt,\nCommotion strange! in all enjoyments else\nSuperiour and unmoved; here only weak\nAgainst the charm of Beauty's powerful glance.\nOr Nature failed in me, and left some part\nNot proof enough such object to sustain;\nOr, from my side subducting, took perhaps\nMore than enough; at least on her bestowed\nToo much of ornament, in outward show\nElaborate, of inward less exact.\nFor well I understand in the prime end\nOf Nature her the inferiour, in the mind\nAnd inward faculties, which most excel;\nIn outward also her resembling less\nHis image who made both, and less expressing\nThe character of that dominion given\nO'er other creatures:  Yet when I approach\nHer loveliness, so absolute she seems\nAnd in herself complete, so well to know\nHer own, that what she wills to do or say,\nSeems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best:\nAll higher knowledge in her presence falls\nDegraded;  Wisdom in discourse with her\nLoses discountenanced, and like Folly shows;\nAuthority and Reason on her wait,\nAs one intended first, not after made\nOccasionally; and, to consummate all,\nGreatness of mind and Nobleness their seat\nBuild in her loveliest, and create an awe\nAbout her, as a guard angelick placed.\nTo whom the Angel with contracted brow.\nAccuse not Nature, she hath done her part;\nDo thou but thine; and be not diffident\nOf Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou\nDismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh,\nBy attributing overmuch to things\nLess excellent, as thou thyself perceivest.\nFor, what admirest thou, what transports thee so,\nAn outside? fair, no doubt, and worthy well\nThy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love;\nNot thy subjection:  Weigh with her thyself;\nThen value:  Oft-times nothing profits more\nThan self-esteem, grounded on just and right\nWell managed; of that skill the more thou knowest,\nThe more she will acknowledge thee her head,\nAnd to realities yield all her shows:\nMade so adorn for thy delight the more,\nSo awful, that with honour thou mayest love\nThy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.\nBut if the sense of touch, whereby mankind\nIs propagated, seem such dear delight\nBeyond all other; think the same vouchsafed\nTo cattle and each beast; which would not be\nTo them made common and divulged, if aught\nTherein enjoyed were worthy to subdue\nThe soul of man, or passion in him move.\nWhat higher in her society thou findest\nAttractive, human, rational, love still;\nIn loving thou dost well, in passion not,\nWherein true love consists not:  Love refines\nThe thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat\nIn reason, and is judicious; is the scale\nBy which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend,\nNot sunk in carnal pleasure; for which cause,\nAmong the beasts no mate for thee was found.\nTo whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied.\nNeither her outside formed so fair, nor aught\nIn procreation common to all kinds,\n(Though higher of the genial bed by far,\nAnd with mysterious reverence I deem,)\nSo much delights me, as those graceful acts,\nThose thousand decencies, that daily flow\nFrom all her words and actions mixed with love\nAnd sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned\nUnion of mind, or in us both one soul;\nHarmony to behold in wedded pair\nMore grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.\nYet these subject not; I to thee disclose\nWhat inward thence I feel, not therefore foiled,\nWho meet with various objects, from the sense\nVariously representing; yet, still free,\nApprove the best, and follow what I approve.\nTo love, thou blamest me not; for Love, thou sayest,\nLeads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide;\nBear with me then, if lawful what I ask:\nLove not the heavenly Spirits, and how their love\nExpress they? by looks only? or do they mix\nIrradiance, virtual or immediate touch?\nTo whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed\nCelestial rosy red, Love's proper hue,\nAnswered.  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest\nUs happy, and without love no happiness.\nWhatever pure thou in the body enjoyest,\n(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy\nIn eminence; and obstacle find none\nOf membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars;\nEasier than air with air, if Spirits embrace,\nTotal they mix, union of pure with pure\nDesiring, nor restrained conveyance need,\nAs flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul.\nBut I can now no more; the parting sun\nBeyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles\nHesperian sets, my signal to depart.\nBe strong, live happy, and love!  But, first of all,\nHim, whom to love is to obey, and keep\nHis great command; take heed lest passion sway\nThy judgement to do aught, which else free will\nWould not admit: thine, and of all thy sons,\nThe weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!\nI in thy persevering shall rejoice,\nAnd all the Blest:  Stand fast;to stand or fall\nFree in thine own arbitrement it lies.\nPerfect within, no outward aid require;\nAnd all temptation to transgress repel.\nSo saying, he arose; whom Adam thus\nFollowed with benediction.  Since to part,\nGo, heavenly guest, ethereal Messenger,\nSent from whose sovran goodness I adore!\nGentle to me and affable hath been\nThy condescension, and shall be honoured ever\nWith grateful memory:  Thou to mankind\nBe good and friendly still, and oft return!\nSo parted they; the Angel up to Heaven\nFrom the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.","title":"Paradise Lost: Book 08"}],"John

God;\nWith whose high strains great George enriches\nHis eloquence of gracious speeches?\nNot faithful to our Highland eyes,\nThese deadly forms of vision rise.\nSome whig-inspiring rebel sprite\nNow palms delusion on our sight.\nI'd scarcely trust a tale so vain,\nShould revelation prompt the strain;\nOr Ossian's ghost the scenes rehearse\nIn all the melody of Erse.\"\n\n\n\"Too long,\" quoth Malcolm, \"from confusion,\nYou've dwelt already in delusion;\nAs sceptics, of all fools the chief,\nHold faith in creeds of unbelief.\nI come to draw thy veil aside\nOf error, prejudice and pride.\nFools love deception, but the wise\nPrefer sad truths to pleasing lies.\nFor know, those hopes can ne'er succeed,\nThat trust on Britain's breaking reed.\nFor weak'ning long from bad to worse,\nBy cureless atrophy of purse,\nShe feels at length with trembling heart,\nHer foes have found her mortal part.\nAs famed Achilles, dipp'd by Thetis\nIn Styx, as sung in antient ditties,\nGrew all case-harden'd o'er, like steel,\nInvulnerable, save his heel;\nAnd laugh'd at swords and spears and squibs,\nAnd all diseases, but the kibes;\nYet met at last his deadly wound,\nBy Paris' arrow nail'd to ground:\nSo Britain's boasted strength deserts\nIn these her empire's utmost skirts,\nRemoved beyond her fierce impressions,\nAnd atmosphere of omnipresence;\nNor to this shore's remoter ends\nHer dwarf-omnipotence extends.\nHence in this turn of things so strange,\n'Tis time our principles to change:\nFor vain that boasted faith, that gathers\nNo perquisite, but tar and feathers;\nNo pay, but stripes from whiggish malice,\nAnd no promotion, but the gallows.\nI've long enough stood firm and steady,\nHalf-hang'd for loyalty already,\nAnd could I save my neck and pelf,\nI'd turn a flaming whig myself.\nBut since, obnoxious here to fate,\nThis saving wisdom comes too late,\nOur noblest hopes already crost,\nOur sal'ries gone, our titles lost,\nDoom'd to worse suff'rings from the mob,\nThan Satan's surg'ries used on Job;\nWhat hope remains, but now with sleight\nWhat's left of us to save by flight?\n\n\n'Now raise thine eyes, for visions true\nAgain ascending wait thy view.'\n\n\n\"I look'd; and clad in early light,\nThe spires of Boston met my sight;\nThe morn o'er eastern hills afar\nIllumed the varied scenes of war;\nGreat Howe had sweetly in the lap\nOf Loring taken out his nap;\nWhen all th' encircling hills around\nWith instantaneous breastworks crown'd,\nWith pointed thunders met his sight,\nLike magic, rear'd the former night.\nEach summit, far as eye commands,\nShone, peopled with rebellious bands.\nAloft their tow'ring heroes rise,\nAs Titans erst assail'd the skies;\nLeagued in superior force to prove\nThe sceptred hand of British Jove.\nMounds piled on hills ascended fair\nWith batt'ries placed in middle air,\nThat hurl'd their fiery bolts amain,\nIn thunder on the trembling plain.\nI saw, along the prostrate strand\nOur baffled generals quit the land,\nEager, as frighted mermaids, flee\nT' our boasted element, the sea,\nAnd tow'rd their town of refuge fly,\nLike convict Jews condemn'd to die.\nThen to the north I turn'd my eyes,\nWhere Saratoga's heights arise,\nAnd saw our chosen vet'ran band\nDescend in terror o'er the land;\nT' oppose this fury of alarms,\nSaw all New-England wake to arms,\nAnd every Yankee, full of mettle,\nSwarm forth, like bees at sound of kettle.\nNot Rome, when Tarquin raped Lucretia,\nSaw wilder must'ring of militia.\nThrough all the woods and plains of fight,\nWhat mortal battles pain'd my sight,\nWhile British corses strew'd the shore,\nAnd Hudson tinged his streams with gore.\nWhat tongue can tell the dismal day,\nOr paint the parti-color'd fray,\nWhen yeomen left their fields afar\nTo plow the crimson plains of war;\nWhen zeal to swords transform'd their shares,\nAnd turn'd their pruning hooks to spears,\nChanged tailor's geese to guns and ball,\nAnd stretch'd to pikes the cobbler's awl;\nWhile hunters, fierce like mighty Nimrod,\nMade on our troops a furious inroad,\nAnd levelling squint on barrel round,\nBrought our beau-officers to ground;\nWhile sunburnt wigs, in high command,\nRush daring on our frighted band,\nAnd ancient beards and hoary hair,\nLike meteors, stream in troubled air;\nWhile rifle-frocks drove Gen'rals cap'ring,\nAnd Red-coats shrunk from leathern apron,\nAnd epaulette and gorget run\nFrom whinyard brown and rusty gun.\nWith locks unshorn not Samson more\nMade useless all the show of war,\nNor fought with ass's jaw for rarity\nWith more success, or singularity.\nI saw our vet'ran thousands yield,\nAnd pile their muskets on the field,\nAnd peasant guards, in rueful plight,\nMarch off our captured bands from fight;\nWhile every rebel fife in play\nTo Yankee-doodle tuned its lay,\nAnd like the music of the spheres,\nMellifluous sooth'd their vanquish'd ears.\"\n\n\n\"Alas, I cried, what baleful star\nSheds fatal influence on the war?\nAnd who that chosen Chief of fame,\nThat heads this grand parade of shame?\"\n\n\n\"There see how fate, great Malcolm cried,\nStrikes with its bolts the tow'rs of pride!\nBehold that martial Macaroni,\nCompound of Phoebus and Bellona,\nEquipp'd alike for feast or fray,\nWith warlike sword and singsong lay,\nWhere equal wit and valour join!\nThis, this is he--the famed Burgoyne!\nWho pawn'd his honor and commission,\nTo coax the patriots to submission,\nBy songs and balls secure allegiance,\nAnd dance the ladies to obedience.\nOft his Camp-Muses he'll parade\nAt Boston in the grand blockade;\nAnd well inspired with punch of arrack,\nHold converse sweet in tent or barrack,\nAroused to more poetic passion,\nBoth by his theme and situation.\nFor genius works more strong and clear\nWhen close confined, like bottled beer.\nSo Prior's wit gain'd matchless power\nBy inspiration of the Tower;\nAnd Raleigh, once to prison hurl'd,\nWrote the whole hist'ry of the world;\nSo Wilkes grew, while in jail he lay,\nMore patriotic every day,\nBut found his zeal, when not confined,\nSoon sink below the freezing point,\nAnd public spirit, once so fair,\nEvaporate in open air.\nBut thou, great favourite of Venus,\nBy no such luck shalt cramp thy genius;\nThy friendly stars, till wars shall cease,\nShall ward th' ill fortune of release,\nAnd hold thee fast in bonds not feeble,\nIn good condition still to scribble.\nSuch merit fate shall shield from firing,\nBomb, carcase, langridge and cold iron,\nNor trust thy doubly-laurell'd head,\nTo rude assaults of flying lead.\nHence thou, from Yankee troops retreating,\nFor pure good fortune shalt be beaten,\nNot taken oft, released or rescued,\nPass for small change, like simple Prescott;\nBut captured then, as fates befall,\nShall stand thy fortune, once for all.\nThen raise thy daring thoughts sublime,\nAnd dip thy conq'ring pen in rhyme,\nAnd changing war for puns and jokes,\nWrite new Blockades and Maids of Oaks.\"\n\n\nThis said, he turn'd and saw the tale\nHad dyed my trembling cheeks with pale;\nThen pitying in a milder vein,\nPursued the visionary strain;\n\n\n\"Too much perhaps hath pain'd your view,\nFrom vict'ries of the Rebel crew.\nNow see the deeds, not small or scanty,\nOf British valour and humanity;\nAnd learn from this heroic sight,\nHow England's sons and friends can fight,\nIn what dread scenes their courage grows,\nAnd how they conquer all their foes.\"\n\n\nI look'd, and saw in wintry skies\nOur spacious prison-walls arise,\nWhere Britons, all their captives taming,\nPlied them with scourging, cold and famine,\nBy noxious food and plagues contagious\nReduced to life's last, fainting stages.\nAmid the dead, that crowd the scene,\nThe moving skeletons were seen.\nAloft the haughty Loring stood,\nAnd thrived, like Vampire, on their blood,\nAnd counting all his gains arising,\nDealt daily rations out, of poison.\nAt hand our troops, in vaunting strain,\nInsulted all their wants and pain,\nAnd turn'd upon the dying tribe\nThe bitter taunt and scornful gibe;\nAnd British captains, chiefs of might,\nExulting in the joyous sight,\nOn foes disarm'd, with courage daring,\nExhausted all their tropes of swearing.\nDistain'd around with rebel blood,\nLike Milton's Lazar house it stood,\nWhere grim Despair presided Nurse,\nAnd Death was Regent of the house.\n\n\nAmazed I cried, \"Is this the way\nThat British valor wins the day?\"\nMore had I said in strains unwelcome,\nTill interrupted thus by Malcolm.\n\n\n\"Blame not, said he, but learn the reason\nOf this new mode of conq'ring treason.\n'Tis but a wise, politic plan\nTo root out all the rebel clan;\nFor surely treason ne'er can thrive\nWhere not a soul is left alive;\nA scheme all other chiefs to surpass,\nAnd do th' effectual work to purpose.\nKnow, War itself is nothing further\nThan th' art and mystery of Murther;\nHe, who most methods has essay'd,\nIs the best Gen'ral of the trade,\nAnd stands Death's plenipotentiary\nTo conquer, poison, starve and bury.\nThis Howe well knew and thus began;\n(Despising Carlton's coaxing plan,\nTo keep his pris'ners well and merry,\nAnd deal them food, like commissary,\nAnd by parol or ransom vain,\nDismiss them all to fight again)\nHence his first captives, with great spirit\nHe tied up, for his troops to fire at,\nAnd hoped they'd learn on foes thus taken,\nTo aim at rebels without shaking.\nThen deep in stratagem, he plann'd\nThe sure destruction of the land;\nTurn'd famine, torture and despair\nTo useful enginry of war;\nSent forth the small-pox, and the greater,\nTo thin the land of every traitor;\nSpread desolation o'er their head,\nAnd plagues in providence's stead;\nPerform'd with equal skill and beauty\nTh' avenging Angel's tour of duty:\nThen bade these prison-walls arise,\nLike temple tow'ring to the skies,\nWhere British Clemency renown'd\nMight fix her seat on hallow'd ground,\n(That Virtue, as each herald saith,\nOf whole blood kin to Punic Faith)\nWhere all her godlike pow'rs unveiling,\nShe finds a grateful shrine to dwell in:\nAnd at this altar for her honor,\nChose this High-priest to wait upon her,\nWho with just rites, in ancient guise,\nOffers the human sacrifice.\nHere every day, her vot'ries tell,\nShe more devours, than th' idol Bel;\nAnd thirsts more rav'nously for gore,\nThan any worshipp'd Power before.\nThat ancient heathen godhead, Moloch,\nOft stay'd his stomach with a bullock;\nAnd if his morning rage you'd check first,\nOne child sufficed him for a breakfast:\nBut British clemency with zeal\nDevours her hundreds at a meal;\nRight well by nat'ralists defined\nA being of carniv'rous kind:\nSo erst Gargantua pleased his palate,\nAnd eat six pilgrims up in sallad.\nNot blest with maw less ceremonious\nThe wide-mouth'd whale, that swallow'd Jonas;\nLike earthquake gapes, to death devote,\nThat open sepulchre, her throat;\nThe grave or barren womb you'd stuff,\nAnd sooner bring to cry, enough;\nOr fatten up to fair condition\nThe lean-flesh'd kine of Pharaoh's vision.\n\n\nBehold her temple, where it stands\nErect, by famed Britannic hands.\n'Tis the Black-hole of Indian structure,\nNew-built in English architecture,\nOn plan, 'tis said, contrived and wrote\nBy Clive, before he cut his throat;\nWho, ere he took himself in hand,\nWas her high-priest in nabob-land:\nAnd when with conq'ring triumph crown'd,\nHe'd well enslaved the nation round,\nWith tender British heart, the Chief,\nSince slavery's worse than loss of life,\nBade desolation circle far,\nAnd famine end the work of war;\nAnd loosed their chains, and for their merits\nDismiss'd them free to worlds of spirits.\nWhence they with choral hymns of praise,\nReturn'd to sooth his latter days,\nAnd hov'ring round his restless bed,\nSpread nightly visions o'er his head.\n\n\nNow turn thine eyes to nobler sights,\nAnd mark the prowess of our fights.\nBehold, like whelps of Britain's lion,\nOur warriors, Clinton, Vaughan, and Tryon,\nMarch forth with patriotic joy\nTo ravish, plunder, burn, destroy.\nGreat Gen'rals, foremost in their nation,\nThe journeymen of Desolation!\nLike Samson's foxes, each assails,\nLet loose with firebrands in their tails,\nAnd spreads destruction more forlorn,\nThan they among Philistine corn.\nAnd see in flames their triumphs rise,\nIlluming all the nether skies,\nO'er-streaming, like a new Aurora,\nThe western hemisphere with glory!\nWhat towns, in ashes laid, confess\nThese heroes' prowess and success!\nWhat blacken'd walls and burning fanes,\nFor trophies spread the ruin'd plains!\nWhat females, caught in evil hour,\nBy force submit to British power;\nOr plunder'd negroes in disaster\nConfess King George their lord and master!\nWhat crimson corses strew their way,\nWhat smoaking carnage dims the day!\nAlong the shore, for sure reduction,\nThey wield the besom of destruction.\nGreat Homer likens, in his Ilias,\nTo dogstar bright the fierce Achilles;\nBut ne'er beheld in red procession\nThree dogstars rise in constellation,\nNor saw, in glooms of evening misty,\nSuch signs of fiery triplicity,\nWhich, far beyond the comet's tail,\nPortend destruction where they sail.\nOh, had Great-Britain's warlike shore\nProduced but ten such heroes more,\nThey'd spared the pains, and held the station\nOf this world's final conflagration;\nWhich when its time comes, at a stand,\nWould find its work all done t' its hand!\n\n\nYet though gay hopes our eyes may bless,\nMalignant fate forbids success;\nLike morning dreams our conquest flies,\nDispersed before the dawn arise.\"\n\n\nHere Malcolm paused; when pond'ring long\nGrief thus gave utt'rance to my tongue.\n\"Where shrink in fear our friends dismay'd,\nAnd where the Tories' promised aid?\nCan none, amid these fierce alarms,\nAssist the power of royal arms?\"\n\"In vain, he cried, our King depends\nOn promised aid of Tory friends.\nWhen our own efforts want success,\nFriends ever fail, as fears increase.\nAs leaves, in blooming verdure wove,\nIn warmth of summer clothe the grove,\nBut when autumnal frosts arise,\nLeave bare their trunks to wintry skies:\nSo, while your power can aid their ends,\nYou ne'er can need ten thousand friends;\nBut once in want, by foes dismay'd,\nMay advertise them, stol'n or stray'd.\nThus ere Great-Britain's force grew slack,\nShe gain'd that aid she did not lack;\nBut now in dread, imploring pity,\nAll hear unmoved her dol'rous ditty;\nAllegiance wand'ring turns astray,\nAnd Faith grows dim for lack of pay.\nIn vain she tries, by new inventions,\nFear, falsehood, flatt'ry, threats and pensions;\nOr sends Commiss'ners with credentials\nOf promises and penitentials.\nAs, for his fare o'er Styx of old,\nThe Trojan stole the bough of gold,\nAnd least grim Cerb'rus should make head,\nStuff'd both his fobs with ginger-bread:\nBehold, at Britain's utmost shifts,\nComes Johnstone loaded with like gifts,\nTo venture through the whiggish tribe,\nTo cuddle, wheedle, coax and bribe:\nAnd call, to aid his desp'rate mission,\nHis petticoated politician,\nWhile Venus, join'd to act the farce,\nStrolls forth embassadress for Mars.\nIn vain he strives, for while he lingers,\nThese mastiffs bite his off'ring fingers;\nNor buys for George and realms infernal\nOne spaniel, but the mongrel, Arnold.\n\n\n\"'Twere vain to paint, in vision'd show,\nThe mighty nothings done by Howe;\nWhat towns he takes in mortal fray,\nAs stations whence to run away;\nWhat triumphs gain'd in conflict warm,\nNo aid to us, to them no harm;\nFor still th' event alike is fatal,\nWhate'er success attend the battle,\nWhether he vict'ry gain or lose it,\nWho ne'er had skill enough to use it.\nAnd better 'twere, at their expense,\nT' have drubb'd him into common sense,\nAnd waked, by bastings on his rear,\nTh' activity, though but of fear.\nBy slow advance his arms prevail,\nLike emblematic march of snail,\nThat, be Millennium nigh or far,\n'Twould long before him end the war.\nFrom York to Philadelphian ground,\nHe sweeps the pompous flourish round,\nWheel'd circ'lar by eccentric stars,\nLike racing boys at prison-bars,\nWho take th' opposing crew in whole,\nBy running round the adverse goal;\nWorks wide the traverse of his course,\nLike ship t' evade the tempest's force;\nLike mill-horse circling in his race,\nAdvances not a single pace,\nAnd leaves no trophies of reduction,\nSave that of cankerworms, destruction.\nThus having long both countries curst,\nHe quits them as he found them first,\nSteers home disgraced, of little worth,\nTo join Burgoyne and rail at North.\n\n\n\"Now raise thine eyes and view with pleasure,\nThe triumphs of his famed successor.\"\n\n\n\"I look'd, and now by magic lore\nFaint rose to view the Jersey shore:\nBut dimly seen in gloom array'd,\nFor night had pour'd her sable shade,\nAnd every star, with glimm'rings pale,\nWas muffled deep in ev'ning veil.\nScarce visible, in dusky night\nAdvancing red-coats rose in sight;\nThe length'ning train in gleaming rows\nStole silent from their slumb'ring foes;\nNo trembling soldier dared to speak,\nAnd not a wheel presumed to creak.\nMy looks my new surprize confess'd,\nTill by great Malcolm thus address'd.\n\"Spend not thy wits in vain researches;\n'Tis one of Clinton's moonlight marches.\nFrom Philadelphia now retreating\nTo save his baffled troops a beating,\nWith hasty strides he flies in vain,\nHis rear attack'd on Monmouth plain.\nWith various chance the dread affray\nHolds in suspense till close of day,\nWhen his tired bands, o'ermatch'd in fight,\nAre rescued by descending night.\nHe forms his camp, with great parade,\nWhile evening spreads the world in shade,\nThen still, like some endanger'd spark,\nSteals off on tiptoe in the dark:\nYet writes his king in boasting tone\nHow grand he march'd by light of moon.\nI see him, but thou canst not; proud\nHe leads in front the trembling crowd,\nAnd wisely knows, as danger's near,\n'Twill fall much heaviest on his rear.\nGo on, great Gen'ral, nor regard\nThe scoffs of every scribbling bard;\nWho sings how gods, that fearful night,\nAided by miracle your flight,\nAs once they used, in Homer's day,\nTo help weak heroes run away;\nTells how the hours, at this sad trial,\nWent back, as erst on Ahaz' dial,\nWhile British Joshua stay'd the moon\nOn Monmouth plains for Ajalon.\nHeed not their sneers or gibes so arch,\nBecause she set before your march.\nA small mistake! your meaning right;\nYou take her influence for her light:\nHer influence, which shall be your guide,\nAnd o'er your Gen'ralship preside.\nHence still shall teem your empty skull\nWith vict'ries, when the moon's at full,\nWhich by transition passing strange\nWane to defeats before the change.\nStill shall you steer, on land or ocean,\nBy like eccentric lunar motion;\nEclips'd in many a fatal crisis,\nAnd dimm'd when Washington arises.\n\n\n\"And see how Fate, herself turn'd traitor,\nInverts the ancient course of nature;\nAnd changes manners, tempers, climes,\nTo suit the genius of the times!\nSee, Bourbon forms a gen'rous plan,\nNew guardian of the rights of man,\nAnd prompt in firm alliance joins\nTo aid the Rebels' proud designs!\nBehold from realms of eastern day\nHis sails innum'rous shape their way,\nIn warlike line the billows sweep,\nAnd roll the thunders of the deep!\nSee, low in equinoctial skies,\nThe western islands fall their prize;\nSee British flags, o'ermatch'd in might,\nPut all their faith in instant flight,\nOr broken squadrons, from th' affray,\nDrag slow their wounded hulks away!\nBehold his Chiefs, in daring setts,\nD'Estaignes, De Grasses and Fayettes,\nSpread through our camps their dread alarms,\nAnd swell the fear of rebel arms!\nYet ere our glories sink in night,\nA gleam of hope shall strike your sight;\nAs lamps, that fail of oil and fire,\nCollect one glimm'ring to expire.\n\n\n\"For lo, where southern shores extend,\nBehold our gather'd hosts descend,\nWhere Charleston views, with varying beams\nHer turrets gild th' encircling streams!\nThere by superior force compell'd,\nBehold their gallant Lincoln yield;\nNor aught the wreaths avail him now,\nPluck'd from Burgoyne's imperious brow.\nSee, furious from the vanquish'd strand,\nCornwallis leads his mighty band;\nThe southern realms and Georgian shore\nSubmit and own the victor's power;\nLo! sunk before his wasting way,\nThe Carolinas fall his prey!\nSee, shrinking from his conq'ring eye,\nThe Rebel legions fall or fly;\nAnd with'ring in these torrid skies,\nThe northern laurel fades and dies!\nWith rapid force he leads his train\nTo fair Virginia's cultured plain,\nTriumphant eyes the travell'd zone,\nAnd boasts the southern realm his own.\n\n\n\"Nor yet this hero's glories bright\nBlaze only in the fields of fight.\nNot Howe's humanity more deserving\nIn gifts of hanging and of starving;\nNot Arnold plunders more tobacco,\nOr steals more negroes for Jamaica;\nScarce Rodney's self, among th' Eustatians,\nInsults so well the laws of nations;\nEv'n Tryon's fame grows dim, and mourning\nHe yields the civic crown of burning.\nI see, with pleasure and surprize,\nNew triumph sparkling in your eyes;\nBut view, where now renew'd in might,\nAgain the Rebels dare the fight.\"\n\"I look'd, and far in southern skies\nSaw Greene, their second hope, arise,\nAnd with his small, but gallant, band.\nInvade the Carolinian land.\nAs winds, in stormy circles whirl'd,\nRush billowy o'er the darken'd world,\nAnd where their wasting fury roves\nSuccessive sweep th' astonish'd groves:\nThus where he pours the rapid fight,\nOur boasted conquests sink in night,\nAnd far o'er all the extended field\nOur forts resign, our armies yield,\nTill now, regain'd the vanquish'd land,\nHe lifts his standard on the strand.\n\n\n\"Again to fair Virginia's coast\nI turn'd and view'd the British host,\nWhere Chesapeak's wide waters lave\nHer shores and join th' Atlantic wave.\nThere famed Cornwallis tow'ring rose,\nAnd scorn'd secure his distant foes;\nHis bands the haughty rampart raise,\nAnd bid the Royal standard blaze.\nWhen lo, where ocean's bounds extend,\nBehold the Gallic sails ascend,\nWith fav'ring breezes stem their way,\nAnd crowd with ships the spacious bay.\nLo! Washington, from northern shores,\nO'er many a region wheels his force,\nAnd Rochambeau, with legions bright,\nDescends in terror to the fight.\nNot swifter cleaves his rapid way\nThe eagle, cow'ring

instantaneous stroke, Burgoyned.\nNot Cadmus view'd with more surprise,\nFrom earth embattled armies rise,\nWho from the dragon's teeth beheld\nMen starting fierce with spear and shield.\nI saw, with looks downcast and grave,\nThe Chief emerging from his cave,\nWhere chased, like fox, in mighty round,\nHis hunters earth'd him first in ground;\nAnd doom'd by fate to rebel sway,\nYield all his

their leagues by sacrifices,\nAnd herds of beasts, to all their deities,\nOblations fell, at close of treaties:\nCornwallis thus, in ancient fashion,\nConcludes his grand capitulation;\nAnd heedless of their screams or suff'rings,\nGives up the Tories for sin-off'rings.\nSee where, relieved from sad embargo,\nSteer off consign'd a recreant cargo;\nLike old scape-goats to roam in pain,\nMark'd like their great forerunner, Cain.\nThe rest now doom'd by British leagues\nTo vengeance of resentful Whigs,\nHold doubtful lives on tenure ill\nOf tenancy at Rebel-will,\nWhile hov'ring o'er their

plain;\nWith mould'ring hulks her ports are fill'd,\nAnd brambles clothe the lonely field!\nSee, on her cliffs her Genius lies,\nHis handkerchief at both his eyes,\nWith many a deep-drawn sigh and groan,\nTo mourn her ruin, and his own!\nWhile joyous Holland, France and Spain\nWith conq'ring navies awe the main;\nAnd Russian banners wide unfurl'd\nSpread commerce round the eastern world.\n\n\nAnd see, (sight hateful and tormenting!)\nThis Rebel Empire, proud and vaunting,\nFrom anarchy shall change her crasis,\nAnd fix her pow'r on firmer basis;\nTo glory, wealth and fame ascend,\nHer commerce wake, her realms extend;\nWhere now the panther guards his den,\nHer desert forests swarm with men;\nGay cities, tow'rs and columns rise,\nAnd dazzling temples meet the

in row\nAdorn'd the sides with verdant show.\nM'Fingal deem'd it vain to stay,\nAnd risk his bones in second fray:\nBut chose a grand retreat from foes,\nIn literal sense, beneath their nose.\nThe window then, which none else knew,\nHe softly open'd and crept through,\nAnd crawling slow in deadly fear,\nBy movements wise made good his rear.\nThen scorning all the fame of martyr,\nFor Boston took his swift departure,\nNor look'd back on the fatal spot,\nMore than the family of Lot.\nNot North in more distress'd condition,\nOut-voted first by opposition;\nNor good King George, when our dire phantom\nOf Independence came to haunt him,\nWhich hov'ring round by night and day,\nNot all his conj'rors e'er could lay.\nHis friends, assembled for his sake,\nHe wisely left in pawn, at stake,\nTo tarring, feath'ring, kicks and drubs\nOf furious, disappointed mobs,\nOr with their forfeit heads to pay\nFor him, their leader, crept away.\nSo when wise Noah summon'd greeting,\nAll animals to gen'ral meeting,\nFrom every side the members went,\nAll kinds of beasts to represent;\nEach, from the flood, took care t' embark,\nAnd save his carcase in the ark:\nBut as it fares in

Honorius, \"we presume\nYou guess from past feats what's to come,\nAnd from the mighty deeds of Gage\nForetell how fierce the war he'll wage.\nYou doubtless recollected here\nThe annals of his first great year:\nWhile, wearying out the Tories' patience,\nHe spent his breath in proclamations;\nWhile all his mighty noise and vapour\nWas used in wrangling upon paper,\nAnd boasted military fits\nClosed in the straining of his wits;\nWhile troops, in Boston commons placed,\nLaid nought, but quires of paper, waste;\nWhile strokes alternate stunn'd the nation,\nProtest, Address and Proclamation,\nAnd speech met speech, fib clash'd with fib,\nAnd Gage still answer'd, squib for squib.\n\n\n\"Though this not all his time was lost on;\nHe fortified the town of Boston,\nBuilt breastworks, that might lend assistance\nTo keep the patriots at a distance;\nFor howsoe'er the rogues might scoff,\nHe liked them best the farthest off;\nWorks of important use to aid\nHis courage, when he felt afraid,\nAnd whence right off, in manful station,\nHe'd boldly pop his proclamation.\nOur hearts must in our bosoms freeze,\nAt such heroic deeds as these.\"\n\n\n\"Vain,\" said the 'Squire, \"you'll find to sneer\nAt Gage's first triumphant year;\nFor Providence, disposed to teaze us,\nCan use what instruments it pleases.\nTo pay a tax, at Peter's wish,\nHis chief cashier was once a fish;\nAn ass, in Balaam's sad disaster,\nTurn'd orator and saved his master;\nA goose, placed sentry on his station,\nPreserved old Rome from desolation;\nAn English bishop's cur of late\nDisclosed rebellions 'gainst the state;\nSo frogs croak'd Pharaoh to repentance,\nAnd lice delay'd the fatal sentence:\nAnd heaven can ruin you at pleasure,\nBy Gage, as soon as by a Cæsar.\nYet did our hero in these days\nPick up some laurel wreaths of praise.\nAnd as the statuary of Seville\nMade his crackt saint an exc'llent devil;\nSo though our war small triumph brings,\nWe gain'd great fame in other things.\n\n\n\"Did not our troops show great discerning,\nAnd skill your various arts in learning?\nOutwent they not each native noodle\nBy far, in playing Yankee-doodle,\nWhich as 'twas your New-England tune,\n'Twas marvellous they took so soon?\nAnd ere the year was fully through,\nDid not they learn to foot it too,\nAnd such a dance, as ne'er was known,\nFor twenty miles on end lead down?\nDid they not lay their heads together,\nAnd gain your art to tar and feather,\nWhen Colonel Nesbit, thro' the town,\nIn triumph bore the country-clown?\nOh what a glorious work to sing\nThe veteran troops of Britain's king,\nAdventuring for th' heroic laurel\nWith bag of feathers and tar-barrel!\nTo paint the cart where culprits ride,\nAnd Nesbitt marching at its side,\nGreat executioner and proud,\nLike hangman high on Holborn road;\nAnd o'er the slow-drawn rumbling car,\nThe waving ensigns of the war!\nAs when a triumph Rome decreed\nFor great Caligula's valiant deed,\nWho had subdued the British seas,\nBy gath'ring cockles from their base;\nIn pompous car the conq'ror bore\nHis captive scallops from the shore,\nOvations gain'd his crabs for fetching,\nAnd mighty feats of oyster-catching:\n'Gainst Yankies thus the war begun,\nThey tarr'd, and triumph'd over, one;\nAnd fought and boasted through the season,\nWith force as great and equal reason.\n\n\n\"Yet thus though skill'd in vict'ry's toils,\nThey boast, not unexpert, in wiles.\nFor gain'd they not an equal fame in\nThe arts of secrecy and scheming;\nIn stratagem show'd wondrous force,\nAnd modernized the Trojan horse,\nPlay'd o'er again the tricks Ulyssean,\nIn their famed Salem expedition?\nFor as that horse, the poets tell ye,\nBore Grecian armies in its belly,\nTill their full reckoning run, with joy\nShrewd Sinon midwived them in Troy:\nSo in one ship was Leslie bold\nCramm'd with three hundred men in hold,\nEquipp'd for enterprize and sail,\nLike Jonas stow'd in womb of whale.\nTo Marblehead in depth of night\nThe cautious vessel wing'd her flight.\nAnd now the sabbath's silent day\nCall'd all your Yankies off to pray;\nSafe from each prying jealous neighbour,\nThe scheme and vessel fell in labor.\nForth from its hollow womb pour'd hast'ly\nThe Myrmidons of Colonel Leslie.\nNot thicker o'er the blacken'd strand,\nThe frogs detachment, rush'd to land,\nFurious by onset and surprize\nTo storm th' entrenchment of the mice.\nThrough Salem straight, without delay,\nThe bold battalion took its way,\nMarch'd o'er a bridge, in open sight\nOf several Yankies arm'd for fight;\nThen without loss of time or men,\nVeer'd round for Boston back again,\nAnd found so well their projects thrive,\nThat every soul got home alive.\n\n\n\"Thus Gage's arms did fortune bless\nWith triumph, safety and success.\nBut mercy is without dispute\nHis first and darling attribute;\nSo great, it far outwent and conquer'd\nHis military skill at Concord.\nThere, when the war he chose to wage,\nShone the benevolence of Gage;\nSent troops to that ill-omen'd place,\nOn errands mere of special grace;\nAnd all the work, he chose them for,\nWas to prevent a civil war;\nFor which kind purpose he projected\nThe only certain way t' effect it,\nTo seize your powder, shot and arms,\nAnd all your means of doing harms;\nAs prudent folks take knives away,\nLest children cut themselves at play.\nAnd yet, when this was all his scheme,\nThe war you still will charge on him;\nAnd tho' he oft has swore and said it,\nStick close to facts, and give no credit.\nThink you, he wish'd you'd brave and beard him?\nWhy, 'twas the very thing, that scared him.\nHe'd rather you should all have run,\nThan staid to fire a single gun.\nSo, for the civil war you lament,\nFaith, you yourselves must take the blame in't;\nFor had you then, as he intended,\nGiven up your arms, it must have ended:\nSince that's no war, each mortal knows,\nWhere one side only gives the blows,\nAnd t'other bears them; on reflection\nThe most we call it is correction.\nNor could the contest have gone higher,\nIf you had ne'er return'd the fire:\nBut when you shot, and not before,\nIt then commenced a civil war.\nElse Gage, to end this controversy,\nHad but corrected you in mercy;\nWhom mother Britain, old and wise,\nSent o'er, the colonies to chastise;\nCommand obedience on their peril\nOf ministerial whip and ferule;\nAnd since they ne'er must come of age,\nGovern'd and tutor'd them by Gage.\nStill more, that mercy was their errand,\nThe army's conduct makes apparent.\nWhat though at Lexington you can say,\nThey kill'd a few, they did not fancy;\nAt Concord then with manful popping,\nDischarged a round, the ball to open;\nYet when they saw your rebel rout\nDetermined still to brave it out,\nDid they not show their love of peace,\nTheir wish that discord straight might cease;\nDemonstrate, and by proofs uncommon,\nTheir orders were to injure no man?\nFor did not every regular run,\nAs soon as e'er you fired a gun;\nTake the first shot you sent them, greeting,\nAs meant their signal for retreating;\nAnd fearful, if they staid for sport,\nYou might by accident be hurt,\nConvey themselves with speed away\nFull twenty miles in half a day;\nRace till their legs were grown so weary,\nThey scarce sufficed their weight to carry?\nWhence Gage extols, from general hearsay,\nThe great activity of Lord Percy;\nWhose brave example led them on,\nAnd spirited the troops to run;\nWho now may boast, at royal levees,\nA Yankee-chace worth forty Chevys.\n\n\n\"Yet you, as vile as they were kind,\nPursued, like tygers, still behind;\nFired on them at your will, and shut\nThe town, as though you'd starve them out;\nAnd with parade preposterous hedged,\nAffect to hold them there besieged:\nThough Gage, whom proclamations call\nYour Gov'rnor and Vice-Admiral,\nWhose power gubernatorial still\nExtends as far as Bunker's hill,\nWhose admiralty reaches, clever,\nNear half a mile up Mistic river,\nWhose naval force yet keeps the seas,\nCan run away whene'er he'd please.\nNay, stern with rage grim Putnam boiling\nPlunder'd both Hogg and Noddle Island;\nScared troops of Tories into town,\nBurn'd all their hay and houses down,\nAnd menaced Gage, unless he'd flee,\nTo drive him headlong to the sea;\nAs once, to faithless Jews a sign,\nThe De'el, turn'd hog-reeve, did the swine.\n\n\n\"But now your triumphs all are o'er;\nFor see from Britain's angry shore,\nWith deadly hosts of valor join\nHer Howe, her Clinton and Burgoyne!\nAs comets thro' th' affrighted skies\nPour baleful ruin as they rise;\nAs Ætna with infernal roar\nIn conflagration sweeps the shore;\nOr as Abijah White, when sent\nOur Marshfield friends to represent,\nHimself while dread array involves,\nCommissions, pistols, swords, resolves,\nIn awful pomp descending down\nBore terror on the factious town:\nNot with less glory and affright,\nParade these generals forth to fight.\nNo more each British colonel runs\nFrom whizzing beetles, as air-guns;\nThinks horn-bugs bullets, or thro' fears\nMuskitoes takes for musketeers;\nNor scapes, as if you'd gain'd supplies,\nFrom Beelzebub's whole host of flies.\nNo bug these warlike hearts appalls;\nThey better know the sound of balls.\nI hear the din of battle bray;\nThe trump of horror marks its way.\nI see afar the sack of cities,\nThe gallows strung with Whig-committees;\nYour moderators triced, like vermin,\nAnd gate-posts graced with heads of chairmen;\nYour Congress for wave-off'rings hanging,\nAnd ladders throng'd with priests haranguing.\nWhat pillories glad the Tories' eyes\nWith patriot ears for sacrifice!\nWhat whipping-posts your chosen race\nAdmit successive in embrace,\nWhile each bears off his sins, alack!\nLike Bunyan's pilgrim, on his back!\nWhere then, when Tories scarce get clear,\nShall Whigs and Congresses appear?\nWhat rocks and mountains will you call\nTo wrap you over with their fall,\nAnd save your heads, in these sad weathers,\nFrom fire and sword, and tar and feathers?\nFor lo! with British troops tar-bright,\nAgain our Nesbitt heaves in sight;\nHe comes, he comes, your lines to storm,\nAnd rig your troops in uniform.\nTo meet such heroes will ye brag,\nWith fury arm'd, and feather-bag,\nWho wield their missile pitch and tar\nWith engines new in British war?\n\n\n\"Lo! where our mighty navy brings\nDestruction on her canvass wings,\nWhile through the deep the British thunder\nShall sound th' alarm, to rob and plunder!\nAs Phoebus first, so Homer speaks,\nWhen he march'd out t' attack the Greeks,\n'Gainst mules sent forth his arrows fatal,\nAnd slew th' auxiliaries, their cattle:\nSo where our ships shall stretch the keel,\nWhat vanquish'd oxen shall they steal!\nWhat heroes, rising from the deep,\nInvade your marshall'd hosts of sheep;\nDisperse whole troops of horse, and pressing,\nMake cows surrender at discretion;\nAttack your hens, like Alexanders,\nAnd regiments rout of geese and ganders;\nOr where united arms combine,\nLead captive many a herd of swine!\nThen rush in dreadful fury down\nTo fire on every seaport town;\nDisplay their glory and their wits,\nFright helpless children into fits;\nAnd stoutly, from the unequal fray,\nMake many a woman run away.\n\n\n\"And can ye doubt, whene'er we please,\nOur chiefs shall boast such deeds as these?\nHave we not chiefs transcending far\nThe old famed thunderbolts of war;\nBeyond the brave knight-errant fighters,\nStiled swords of death, by novel-writers;\nNor in romancing ages e'er rose\nSo terrible a tier of heroes.\nFrom Gage what sounds alarm the waves!\nHow loud a blunderbuss is Graves!\nHow Newport dreads the blustering sallies,\nThat thunder from our popgun, Wallace,\nWhile noise in formidable strains,\nSpouts from his thimble-full of brains!\nI see you sink in awed surprise!\nI see our Tory brethren rise!\nAnd as the sect'ries Sandemanian,\nOur friends, describe their hoped millennium;\nBoast how the world in every region\nAt once shall own their true religion,\nFor heaven shall knock, with vengeance dread,\nAll unbelievers on the head;\nAnd then their church, the meek in spirit,\nThe earth, as promised, shall inherit\nFrom the dead wicked, as heirs male,\nOr next remainder-men in tail:\nSuch ruin shall the Whigs oppress;\nSuch spoils our Tory friends shall bless:\nWhile Confiscation at command\nShall stalk in terror through the land,\nShall give all whig-estates away,\nAnd call our brethren into play.\n\n\n\"And can you pause, or scruple more?\nThese things are near you, at the door.\nBehold! for though to reasoning blind,\nSigns of the times you still might mind,\nAnd view impending fate, as plain\nAs you'd foretell a shower of rain.\n\n\n\"Hath not heaven warn'd you what must ensue.\nAnd providence declared against you?\nHung forth the dire

sound,\nStill cries, like Abel's, from the ground;\nAnd heaven, attentive to its call,\nShall doom the proud oppressor's fall.\n\n\n\"Rise then, ere ruin swift surprize,\nTo victory, to vengeance, rise.\nHark, how the distant din alarms;\nThe echoing trumpet breathes, to arms.\nFrom provinces remote afar,\nThe sons of glory rouse to war.\n'Tis Freedom calls! the raptured sound\nThe Apalachian hills rebound.\nThe Georgian coasts her voice shall hear,\nAnd start from lethargies of fear.\nFrom the parch'd zone, with glowing ray\nWhere pours the sun intenser day,\nTo shores where icy waters roll,\nAnd tremble to the glimm'ring pole,\nInspired by freedom's heavenly charms,\nUnited nations wake to arms.\nThe star of conquest lights their way,\nAnd guides their vengeance on their prey.\nYes, though tyrannic force oppose,\nStill shall they triumph o'er their foes;\nTill heaven the happy land shall bless\nWith safety, liberty and peace.\n\n\n\"And ye, whose souls of dastard

horrors of coercion,\nFire, blood and thunder in reversion;\nKing's standards, pill'ries, confiscations,\nAnd Gage's scare-crow proclamations;\nWho scarce could rouse, if caught in fray,\nPresence of mind to run away;\nSee nought but halters rise to view,\nIn all your dreams, and deem them true;\nAnd while these phantoms haunt your brains,\nBow down your willing necks to chains.\nHeavens! are ye sons of sires so great,\nImmortal in the fields of fate,\nWho braved all deaths, by land or sea,\nWho bled, who conquer'd, to be free?\nHence coward souls, the worst disgrace\nOf our forefathers' valiant race;\nHie homeward from the glorious field,\nThere turn the wheel, the distaff wield;\nAct what ye are, nor dare to stain\nThe warrior's arms with touch profane;\nThere beg your more heroic wives\nTo guard your own, your children's, lives;\nBeneath their aprons seek a screen,\nNor dare to mingle more with men.\"\n\n\nAs thus he spake, the Tories' anger\nCould now restrain itself no longer;\nWho tried before by many a freak, or\nInsulting noise, to stop the speaker;\nSwung th' un-oil'd hinge of each pew-door,\nTheir feet kept shuffling on the floor;\nMade their disapprobation known\nBy many a murmur, hum and groan,\nThat to his speech supplied the place\nOf counterpart in thorough bass.\nThus bagpipes, while the tune they breathe,\nStill drone and grumble underneath;\nAnd thus the famed Demosthenes\nHarangued the rumbling of the seas,\nHeld forth with elocution grave,\nTo audience loud of wind and wave;\nAnd had a stiller congregation,\nThan Tories are, to hear th' oration.\nThe uproar now grew high and louder,\nAs nearer thund'rings of a cloud are,\nAnd every soul with heart and voice\nSupplied his quota of the noise.\nEach listening ear was set on torture,\nEach Tory bellowing, \"Order, Order;\"\nAnd some, with tongue not low or weak,\nWere clam'ring fast, for leave to speak;\nThe Moderator, with great vi'lence,\nThe cushion thump'd with, \"Silence, Silence!\"\nThe Constable to every prater\nBawl'd out, \"Pray hear the moderator;\"\nSome call'd the vote, and some in turn\nWere screaming high, \"Adjourn, Adjourn.\"\nNot Chaos heard such jars and clashes,\nWhen all the el'ments fought for places.\nThe storm each moment fiercer grew;\nHis sword the great M'Fingal drew,\nPrepared in either chance to share,\nTo keep the peace, or aid the war.\nNor lack'd they each poetic being,\nWhom bards alone are skill'd in seeing;\nPlumed Victory stood perch'd on high,\nUpon the pulpit-canopy,\nTo join, as is her custom tried,\nLike Indians, on the strongest side;\nThe Destinies, with shears and distaff,\nDrew near their threads of life to twist off;\nThe Furies 'gan to feast on blows,\nAnd broken head, and bloody nose:\nWhen on a sudden from without\nArose a loud terrific shout;\nAnd straight the people all at once heard\nOf tongues an universal concert;\nLike Æsop's times, as fable runs,\nWhen every creature talk'd at once,\nOr like the variegated gabble,\nThat crazed the carpenters of Babel.\nEach party soon forsook the quarrel,\nAnd let the other go on parol,\nEager to know what fearful matter\nHad conjured up such general clatter;\nAnd left the church in thin array,\nAs though it had been lecture-day.\nOur 'Squire M'Fingal straitway beckon'd\nThe Constable to stand his second;\nAnd sallied forth with aspect fierce\nThe crowd assembled to disperse.\n\n\nThe Moderator, out of view,\nBeneath the desk had lain perdue;\nPeep'd up his head to view the fray,\nBeheld the wranglers run away,\nAnd left alone, with solemn face\nAdjourn'd them without time or place.","title":"M'Fingal - Canto II"},{"lines":"In elder days, in Saturn's prime,\nEre baldness seized the head of Time,\nWhile truant Jove, in infant pride,\nPlay'd barefoot on Olympus' side,\nEach thing on earth had power to chatter,\nAnd spoke the mother tongue of nature.\nEach stock or stone could prate and gabble,\nWorse than ten labourers of Babel.\nAlong the street, perhaps you'd see\nA Post disputing with a Tree,\nAnd mid their arguments of weight,\nA Goose sit umpire of debate.\nEach Dog you met, though speechless now,\nWould make his compliments and bow,\nAnd every Swine with congees come,\nTo know how did all friends at home.\nEach Block sublime could make a speech,\nIn style and eloquence as rich,\nAnd could pronounce it and could pen it,\nAs well as Chatham in the senate.\n\n\nNor prose alone.--In these young times,\nEach field was fruitful too in rhymes;\nEach feather'd minstrel felt the passion,\nAnd every wind breathed inspiration.\nEach Bullfrog croak'd in loud bombastic,\nEach Monkey chatter'd Hudibrastic;\nEach Cur, endued with yelping nature,\nCould outbark Churchill's[2] self in satire;\nEach Crow in prophecy delighted,\nEach Owl, you saw, was second-sighted,\nEach Goose a skilful politician,\nEach Ass a gifted met'physician,\nCould preach in wrath 'gainst laughing rogues,\nWrite Halfway-covenant Dialogues,[3]\nAnd wisely judge of all disputes\nIn commonwealths of men or brutes.\n\n\n'Twas then, in spring a youthful Sparrow\nFelt the keen force of Cupid's arrow:\nFor Birds, as Æsop's tales avow,\nMade love then, just as men do now,\nAnd talk'd of deaths and flames and darts,\nAnd breaking necks and losing hearts;\nAnd chose from all th' aerial kind,\nNot then to tribes, like Jews, confined\nThe story tells, a lovely Thrush\nHad smit him from a neigh'bring bush,\nWhere oft the young coquette would play,\nAnd carol sweet her siren lay:\nShe thrill'd each feather'd heart with love,\nAnd reign'd the Toast of all the grove.\n\n\nHe felt the pain, but did not dare\nDisclose his passion to the fair;\nFor much he fear'd her conscious pride\nOf race, to noble blood allied.\nHer grandsire's nest conspicuous stood,\nMid loftiest branches of the wood,\nIn airy height, that scorn'd to know\nEach flitting wing that waved below.\nSo doubting, on a point so nice\nHe deem'd it best to take advice.\n\n\nHard by there dwelt an aged Owl,\nOf all his friends the gravest fowl;\nWho from the cares of business free,\nLived, hermit, in a hollow tree;\nTo solid learning bent his mind,\nIn trope and syllogism he shined,\n'Gainst reigning follies spent his railing;\nToo much a Stoic--'twas his failing.\n\n\nHither for aid our Sparrow came,\nAnd told his errand and his name,\nWith panting breath explain'd his case,\nMuch trembling at the sage's face;\nAnd begg'd his Owlship would declare\nIf love were worth a wise one's care.\n\n\nThe grave Owl heard the weighty cause,\nAnd humm'd and hah'd at every pause;\nThen fix'd his looks in sapient plan,\nStretch'd forth one foot, and thus began.\n\n\n\"My son, my son, of love beware,\nAnd shun the cheat of beauty's snare;\nThat snare more dreadful to be in,\nThan huntsman's net, or horse-hair gin.\n\"By others' harms learn to be wise,\"\nAs ancient proverbs well advise.\nEach villany, that nature breeds,\nFrom females and from love proceeds.\n'Tis love disturbs with fell debate\nOf man and beast the peaceful state:\nMen fill the world with war's alarms,\nWhen female trumpets sound to arms;\nThe commonwealth of dogs delight\nFor beauties, as for bones, to fight.\nLove hath his tens of thousands slain,\nAnd heap'd with copious death the plain:\nSamson, with ass's jaw to aid,\nNe'er peopled thus th'infernal shade.\n\n\n\"Nor this the worst; for he that's dead,\nWith love no more will vex his head.\n'Tis in the rolls of fate above,\nThat death's a certain cure for love;\nA noose can end the cruel smart;\nThe lover's leap is from a cart.\nBut oft a living death they bear,\nScorn'd by the proud, capricious fair.\nThe fair to sense pay no regard,\nAnd beauty is the fop's reward;\nThey slight the generous hearts' esteem,\nAnd sigh for those, who fly from them.\n\n\nJust when your wishes would prevail,\nSome rival bird with gayer tail,\nWho sings his strain with sprightlier note,\nAnd chatters praise with livelier throat,\nShall charm your flutt'ring fair one down,\nAnd leave your choice, to hang or drown.\n\n\nEv'n I, my son, have felt the smart;\nA Pheasant won my youthful heart.\nFor her I tuned the doleful lay,[4]\nFor her I watch'd the night away;\nIn vain I told my piteous case,\nAnd smooth'd my dignity of face;\nIn vain I cull'd the studied phrase,\nAnd sought hard words in beauty's praise.\nHer, not my charms nor sense could move,\nFor folly is the food of love.\nEach female scorns our serious make,\n\"Each woman is at heart a rake.\"[5]\nThus Owls in every age have

tongues he hears,\nAnd clubs and stones assail his ears.\nTo fly was vain; to fight was idle;\nBy foes encompass'd in the middle,\nHis hope, in stratagems, he found,\nAnd fell right craftily to ground;\nThen crept to seek an hiding place,\n'Twas all he could, beneath a brace;\nWhere soon the conq'ring crew espied him,\nAnd where he lurk'd, they caught and tied him.\n\n\nAt once with resolution fatal,\nBoth Whigs and Tories rush'd to battle.\nInstead of weapons, either band\nSeized on such arms as came to hand.\nAnd as famed Ovid paints th' adventures\nOf wrangling Lapithæ and Centaurs,\nWho at their feast, by Bacchus led,\nThrew bottles at each other's head;\nAnd these arms failing in their scuffles,\nAttack'd with andirons, tongs and shovels:\nSo clubs and billets, staves and stones\nMet fierce, encountering every sconce,\nAnd cover'd o'er with knobs and pains\nEach void receptacle for brains;\nTheir clamours rend the skies around,\nThe hills rebellow to the sound;\nAnd many a groan increas'd the din\nFrom batter'd nose and broken shin.\nM'Fingal, rising at the word,\nDrew forth his old militia-sword;\nThrice cried \"King George,\" as erst in distress,\nKnights of romance invoked a mistress;\nAnd brandishing the blade in air,\nStruck terror through th' opposing war.\nThe Whigs, unsafe within the wind\nOf such commotion, shrunk behind.\nWith whirling steel around address'd,\nFierce through their thickest throng he press'd,\n(Who roll'd on either side in arch,\nLike Red Sea waves in Israel's march)\nAnd like a meteor rushing through,\nStruck on their Pole a vengeful blow.\nAround, the Whigs, of clubs and stones\nDischarged whole vollies, in platoons,\nThat o'er in whistling fury fly;\nBut not a foe dares venture nigh.\nAnd now perhaps with glory crown'd\nOur 'Squire had fell'd the pole to ground,\nHad not some Pow'r, a whig at heart,\nDescended down and took their part;\n(Whether 'twere Pallas, Mars or Iris,\n'Tis scarce worth while to make inquiries)\nWho at the nick of time alarming,\nAssumed the solemn form of Chairman,\nAddress'd a Whig, in every scene\nThe stoutest wrestler on the green,\nAnd pointed where the spade was found,\nLate used to set their pole in ground,\nAnd urged, with equal arms and might,\nTo dare our 'Squire to single fight.\nThe Whig thus arm'd, untaught to yield,\nAdvanced tremendous to the field:\nNor did M'Fingal shun the foe,\nBut stood to brave the desp'rate blow;\nWhile all the party gazed, suspended\nTo see the deadly combat ended;\nAnd Jove in equal balance weigh'd\nThe sword against the brandish'd spade,\nHe weigh'd; but lighter than a dream,\nThe sword flew up, and kick'd the beam.\nOur 'Squire on tiptoe rising fair\nLifts high a noble stroke in air,\nWhich hung not, but like dreadful engines,\nDescended on his foe in vengeance.\nBut ah! in danger, with dishonor\nThe sword perfidious fails its owner;\nThat sword, which oft had stood its ground,\nBy huge trainbands encircled round;\nAnd on the bench, with blade right loyal,\nHad won the day at many a trial,\nOf stones and clubs had braved th' alarms,\nShrunk from these new Vulcanian arms.\nThe spade so temper'd from the sledge,\nNor keen nor solid harm'd its edge,\nNow met it, from his arm of might,\nDescending with steep force to smite;\nThe blade snapp'd short--and from his hand,\nWith rust embrown'd the glittering sand.\nSwift turn'd M'Fingal at the view,\nAnd call'd to aid th' attendant crew,\nIn vain; the Tories all had run,\nWhen scarce the fight was well begun;\nTheir setting wigs he saw decreas'd\nFar in th' horizon tow'rd the west.\nAmazed he view'd the shameful sight,\nAnd saw no refuge, but in flight:\nBut age unwieldy check'd his pace,\nThough fear had wing'd his flying race;\nFor not a trifling prize at stake;\nNo less than great M'Fingal's back.\nWith legs and arms he work'd his course,\nLike rider that outgoes his horse,\nAnd labor'd hard to get away, as\nOld Satan struggling on through chaos;\nTill looking back, he spied in rear\nThe spade-arm'd chief advanced too near:\nThen stopp'd and seized a stone, that lay\nAn ancient landmark near the way;\nNor shall we as old bards have done,\nAffirm it weigh'd an hundred ton;\nBut such a stone, as at a shift\nA modern might suffice to lift,\nSince men, to credit their enigmas,\nAre dwindled down to dwarfs and pigmies,\nAnd giants exiled with their cronies\nTo Brobdignags and Patagonias.\nBut while our Hero turn'd him round,\nAnd tugg'd to raise it from the ground,\nThe fatal spade discharged a blow\nTremendous on his rear below:\nHis bent knee fail'd, and void of strength\nStretch'd on the ground his manly length.\nLike ancient oak o'erturn'd, he lay,\nOr tower to tempests fall'n a prey,\nOr mountain sunk with all his pines,\nOr flow'r the plow to dust consigns,\nAnd more things else--but all men know 'em,\nIf slightly versed in epic poem.\nAt once the crew, at this dread crisis,\nFall on, and bind him, ere he rises;\nAnd with loud shouts and joyful soul,\nConduct him prisoner to the pole.\nWhen now the mob in lucky hour\nHad got their en'mies in their power,\nThey first proceed, by grave command,\nTo take the Constable in hand.\nThen from the pole's sublimest top\nThe active crew let down the rope,\nAt once its other end in haste bind,\nAnd make it fast upon his waistband;\nTill like the earth, as stretch'd on tenter,\nHe hung self-balanced on his centre.\nThen upwards, all hands hoisting sail,\nThey swung him, like a keg of ale,\nTill to the pinnacle in height\nHe vaulted, like balloon or kite.\nAs Socrates of old at first did\nTo aid philosophy get hoisted,\nAnd found his thoughts flow strangely clear,\nSwung in a basket in mid air:\nOur culprit thus, in purer sky,\nWith like advantage raised his eye,\nAnd looking forth in prospect wide,\nHis Tory errors clearly spied,\nAnd from his elevated station,\nWith bawling voice began addressing.\n\n\n\"Good Gentlemen and friends and kin,\nFor heaven's sake hear, if not for mine!\nI here renounce the Pope, the Turks,\nThe King, the Devil and all their works;\nAnd will, set me but once at ease,\nTurn Whig or Christian, what you please;\nAnd always mind your rules so justly,\nShould I live long as old Methus'lah,\nI'll never join in British rage,\nNor help Lord North, nor Gen'ral Gage;\nNor lift my gun in future fights,\nNor take away your Charter-rights;\nNor overcome your new-raised levies,\nDestroy your towns, nor burn your navies;\nNor cut your poles down while I've breath,\nThough raised more thick than hatchel-teeth:\nBut leave King George and all his elves\nTo do their conq'ring work themselves.\"\n\n\nThis said, they lower'd him down in state,\nSpread at all points, like falling cat;\nBut took a vote first on the question,\nThat they'd accept this full confession,\nAnd to their fellowship and favor,\nRestore him on his good behaviour.\n\n\nNot so our 'Squire submits to rule,\nBut stood, heroic as a mule.\n\"You'll find it all in vain, quoth he,\nTo play your rebel tricks on me.\nAll punishments, the world can render,\nServe only to provoke th' offender;\nThe will gains strength from treatment horrid,\nAs hides grow harder when they're curried.\nNo man e'er felt the halter draw,\nWith good opinion of

guard\nA Bench of Justice had prepared,\nWhere sitting round in awful sort\nThe grand Committee hold their Court;\nWhile all the crew, in silent awe,\nWait from their lips the lore of law.\nFew moments with deliberation\nThey hold the solemn consultation;\nWhen soon in judgment all agree,\nAnd Clerk proclaims the dread decree;\n\"That 'Squire M'Fingal having grown\nThe vilest Tory in the town,\nAnd now in full examination\nConvicted by his own confession,\nFinding no tokens of repentance,\nThis Court proceeds to render sentence:\nThat first the Mob a slip-knot single\nTie round the neck of said M'Fingal,\nAnd in due form do tar him next,\nAnd feather, as the law directs;\nThen through the town attendant ride him\nIn cart with Constable beside him,\nAnd having held him up to shame,\nBring to the pole, from whence he came.\"\n\n\nForthwith the crowd proceed to deck\nWith halter'd noose M'Fingal's neck,\nWhile he in peril of his soul\nStood tied half-hanging to the pole;\nThen lifting high the ponderous jar,\nPour'd o'er his head the smoaking tar.\nWith less profusion once was spread\nOil on the Jewish monarch's head,\nThat down his beard and vestments ran,\nAnd cover'd all his outward man.\nAs when (so Claudian sings) the Gods\nAnd earth-born Giants fell at odds,\nThe stout Enceladus in malice\nTore mountains up to throw at Pallas;\nAnd while he held them o'er his head,\nThe river, from their fountains fed,\nPour'd down his back its copious tide,\nAnd wore its channels in his hide:\nSo from the high-raised urn the torrents\nSpread down his side their various currents;\nHis flowing wig, as next the brim,\nFirst met and drank the sable stream;\nAdown his visage stern and grave\nRoll'd and adhered the viscid wave;\nWith arms depending as he stood,\nEach cuff capacious holds the flood;\nFrom nose and chin's remotest end,\nThe tarry icicles descend;\nTill all o'erspread, with colors gay,\nHe glitter'd to the western ray,\nLike sleet-bound trees in wintry skies,\nOr Lapland idol carved in ice.\nAnd now the feather-bag display'd\nIs waved in triumph o'er his head,\nAnd clouds him o'er with feathers missive,\nAnd down, upon the tar, adhesive:\nNot Maia's son, with wings for ears,\nSuch plumage round his visage wears;\nNor Milton's six-wing'd angel gathers\nSuch superfluity of feathers.\nNow all complete appears our 'Squire,\nLike Gorgon or Chimæra dire;\nNor more could boast on Plato's plan\nTo rank among the race of man,\nOr prove his claim to human nature,\nAs a two-legg'd, unfeather'd creature.\n\n\nThen on the fatal cart, in state\nThey raised our grand Duumvirate.\nAnd as at Rome a like committee,\nWho found an owl within their city,\nWith solemn rites and grave processions\nAt every shrine perform'd lustrations;\nAnd least infection might take place\nFrom such grim fowl with feather'd face,\nAll Rome attends him through the street\nIn triumph to his country seat:\nWith like devotion all the choir\nParaded round our awful 'Squire;\nIn front the martial music comes\nOf horns and fiddles, fifes and drums,\nWith jingling sound of carriage bells,\nAnd treble creak of rusted wheels.\nBehind, the croud, in lengthen'd row\nWith proud procession, closed the show.\nAnd at fit periods every throat\nCombined in universal shout;\nAnd hail'd great Liberty in chorus,\nOr bawl'd 'confusion to the Tories.'\nNot louder storm the welkin braves\nFrom clamors of conflicting waves;\nLess dire in Lybian wilds the noise\nWhen rav'ning lions lift their voice;\nOr triumphs at town-meetings made,\nOn passing votes to regulate trade.\n\n\nThus having borne them round the town,\nLast at the pole they set them down;\nAnd to the tavern take their way\nTo end in mirth the festal day.\n\n\nAnd now the Mob, dispersed and gone,\nLeft 'Squire and Constable alone.\nThe constable with rueful face\nLean'd sad and solemn o'er a brace;\nAnd fast beside him, cheek by jowl,\nStuck 'Squire M'Fingal 'gainst the pole,\nGlued by the tar t' his rear applied,\nLike barnacle on vessel's side.\nBut though his body lack'd physician,\nHis spirit was in worse condition.\nHe found his fears of whips and ropes\nBy many a drachm outweigh'd his hopes.\nAs men in jail without mainprize\nView every thing with other eyes,\nAnd all goes wrong in church and state,\nSeen through perspective of the grate:\nSo now M'Fingal's Second-sight\nBeheld all things in gloomier light;\nHis visual nerve, well purged with tar,\nSaw all the coming scenes of war.\nAs his prophetic soul grew stronger,\nHe found he could hold in no longer.\nFirst from the pole, as fierce he shook,\nHis wig from pitchy durance broke,\nHis mouth unglued, his feathers flutter'd,\nHis tarr'd skirts crack'd, and thus he utter'd.\n\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Constable, in vain\nWe strive 'gainst wind and tide and rain!\nBehold my doom! this feathery omen\nPortends what dismal times are coming.\nNow future scenes, before my eyes,\nAnd second-sighted forms arise.\nI hear a voice, that calls away,\nAnd cries 'The Whigs will win the day.'\nMy beck'ning Genius gives command,\nAnd bids me fly the fatal land;\nWhere changing name and constitution,\nRebellion turns to Revolution,\nWhile Loyalty, oppress'd, in tears,\nStands trembling for its neck and ears.\n\n\n\"Go, summon all our brethren, greeting,\nTo muster at our usual meeting;\nThere my prophetic

was never in his thought,\nAnd wealth he valued not a groat.\nIngratitude he often found,\nAnd pitied those who meant the wound;\nBut kept the tenor of his mind\nTo merit well of human kind;\nNor made a sacrifice of those\nWho still were true, to please his foes.\nHe laboured many a fruitless hour\nTo reconcile his friends in power;\nSaw mischief by a faction brewing,\nWhile they pursued each other's ruin.\nBut finding vain was all his care,\nHe left the court in mere despair.\nAnd oh! how short are human schemes!\nHere ended all our golden dreams.\nWhat St John's skill in state affairs,\nWhat Ormond's valour, Oxford's cares,\nTo save their sinking country lent,\nWas all destroyed by one event.\nToo soon that precious life was ended,\nOn which alone our weal depended.\nWhen up a dangerous faction starts,\nWith wrath and vengeance in their hearts,\nBy solemn League and Cov'nant bound,\nTo ruin, slaughter, and confound;\nTo turn religion to a fable,\nAnd make the

land,\nHow could unguarded Virtue stand!\nWith horror, grief, despair, the Dean\nBeheld the dire destructive scene:\nHis friends in exile, or the tower,\nHimself within the frown of power,\nPursued by base envenomed pens,\nFar to the land of slaves and fens;\nA servile race in folly nursed,\nWho truckle most when treated worst.\nBy innocence and resolution,\nHe bore continual persecution;\nWhile numbers to preferment rose,\nWhose merits were, to be his foes;\nWhen ev'n his own familiar friends,\nIntent upon their private ends,\nLike renegadoes now he feels,\nAgainst him lifting up their heels.\nThe Dean did by his pen defeat\nAn infamous destructive cheat;\nTaught fools their int'rest how to know,\nAnd gave them arms to ward the blow.\nEnvy has owned it was his doing,\nTo save that hapless land from ruin;\nWhile they who at the steerage stood,\nAnd reaped the profit, sought his blood.\nTo save them from their evil fate,\nIn him was held a crime of state.\nA wicked monster on the bench,\nWhose fury blood could never quench\n- As vile and profligate a villain\nAs modern Scroggs, or old Tresilian;\nWho long all justice had discarded,\nNor feared he God, nor man regarded -\nVowed on the Dean his rage to vent,\nAnd make him of his zeal repent.\nBut Heaven his innocence defends,\nThe grateful people stand his friends:\nNot strains of law, nor judge's frown,\nNor topics brought to please the crown,\nNor witness hired, nor jury picked,\nPrevail to bring him in convict.\nIn exile, with a steady heart,\nHe spent his life's declining part;\nWhere folly, pride, and faction sway,\nRemote from St John, Pope, and Gay.\nAlas, poor Dean! his only scope\nWas to be held a misanthrope.\nThis into gen'ral odium drew him,\nWhich, if he liked, much good may't do him.\nHis zeal was not to lash our crimes,\nBut discontent against the times;\nFor had we made him timely offers\nTo raise his post, or fill his coffers,\nPerhaps he might have truckled down,\nLike other brethren of his gown.\nFor party he would scarce have bled -\nI say no more, because he's dead.\nWhat writings has he left behind?\nI hear they're of a different kind:\nA few in verse, but most in prose,\n- Some high-flown pamphlets, I suppose -\nAll scribbled in the worst of times,\nTo palliate his friend Oxford's crimes,\nTo praise Queen Anne, nay more, defend her,\nAs never fav'ring the Pretender;\nOr libels yet concealed from sight,\nAgainst the court to show his spite;\nPerhaps his Travels, part the third,\nA lie at every second word,\nOffensive to a loyal ear;\nBut not one sermon, you may swear.\"\n\n\"His friendships there, to few confined,\nWere always of the middling kind:\nNo fools of rank, a mongrel breed,\nWho fain would pass for lords indeed.\nWhere titles give no right or power,\nAnd peerage is a withered flower,\nHe would have held it a disgrace\nIf such a wretch had known his face.\nOn rural squires, that kingdom's bane,\nHe vented oft his wrath in vain;\n[Biennial] squires to market brought,\nWho sell their souls and [votes] for nought;\nThe [nation stripped,] go joyful back,\nTo [rob the] church, their tenants rack,\nGo snacks with [rogues and rapparees,]\nAnd keep the peace to pick up fees;\nIn every job to have a share,\nA goal or barrack to repair;\nAnd turn the tax for public roads\nCommodious to their own abodes.\"\n\"Perhaps I may allow the Dean\nHad too much satire in his vein,\nAnd seemed determined not to starve it,\nBecause no age could more deserve it.\nYet malice never was his aim;\nHe lashed the vice, but spared the name;\nNo individual could resent\nWhere thousands equally were meant.\nHis satire points at no defect\nBut what all mortals may correct;\nFor he abhorred that senseless tribe\nWho call it humour when they gibe.\nHe spared a hump, or crooked nose,\nWhose owners set not up for beaux.\nTrue genuine dulness moved his pity,\nUnless it offered to be witty.\nThose who their ignornace confessed\nHe ne'er offended with a jest;\nBut laughed to hear an idiot quote\nA verse from Horace learned by rote.\nVice, if it e'er can be abashed,\nMust be or ridiculed or lashed.\nIf you resent it, who's to blame?\nHe neither knew you nor your name.\nShould vice expect to 'scape rebuke,\nBecause its owner is a duke?\"\n\"He knew an hundred pleasant stories,\nWith all the turns of Whigs and Tories;\nWas cheerful to his dying day,\nAnd friends would let him have his way.\"\n\"He gave what little wealth he had\nTo build a house for fools and mad;\nAnd showed by one satiric touch,\nNo nation wanted it so much.\nThat kingdom he hath left his debtor,\nI wish it soon may have a better.\"\nAnd since you dread no further lashes,\nMethinks you may forgive his ashes.","title":"Verses on the Death of Doctor Swift"},{"lines":"Ye

and marble loud their woe confessed,\nThe silver monstrances that Popes had blessed,\nThe chalices and lamps and crosiers rare\nWere seared and twisted by a flaming breath;\nThe horror everywhere did range and swell,\nThe guardian Saints into this furnace fell,\nTheir bitter tears and screams were stilled in death.\nAround the flames armed hosts are skirmishing,\nThe burning sun reflects the lurid scene;\nThe German army, fighting for its life,\nRallies its torn and terrified left wing;\nAnd, as they near this place\nThe imperial eagles see\nBefore them in their flight,\nHere, in the solemn

H. H.: 131. O living will that shalt endure"},{"lines":"The brave Geraint, a knight of Arthur's court,\nA tributary prince of Devon, one\nOf that great Order of the Table Round,\nHad married Enid, Yniol's only child,\nAnd loved her, as he loved the light of Heaven.\nAnd as the light of Heaven varies, now\nAt sunrise, now at sunset, now by night\nWith moon and trembling stars, so loved Geraint\nTo make her beauty vary day by day,\nIn crimsons and in purples and in gems.\nAnd Enid, but to please her husband's eye,\nWho first had found and loved her in a state\nOf broken fortunes, daily fronted him\nIn some fresh splendour; and the Queen herself,\nGrateful to Prince Geraint for service done,\nLoved her, and often with her own white hands\nArrayed and decked her, as the loveliest,\nNext after her own self, in all the court.\nAnd Enid loved the Queen, and with true heart\nAdored her, as the stateliest and the best\nAnd loveliest of all women upon earth.\nAnd seeing them so tender and so close,\nLong in their common love rejoiced Geraint.\nBut when a rumour rose about the Queen,\nTouching her guilty love for Lancelot,\nThough yet there lived no proof, nor yet was heard\nThe world's loud whisper breaking into storm,\nNot less Geraint believed it; and there fell\nA horror on him, lest his gentle wife,\nThrough that great tenderness for Guinevere,\nHad suffered, or should suffer any taint\nIn nature: wherefore going to the King,\nHe made this pretext, that his princedom lay\nClose on the borders of a territory,\nWherein were bandit earls, and caitiff knights,\nAssassins, and all flyers from the hand\nOf Justice, and whatever loathes a law:\nAnd therefore, till the King himself should please\nTo cleanse this common sewer of all his realm,\nHe craved a fair permission to depart,\nAnd there defend his marches; and the King\nMused for a little on his plea, but, last,\nAllowing it, the Prince and Enid rode,\nAnd fifty knights rode with them, to the shores\nOf Severn, and they past to their own land;\nWhere, thinking, that if ever yet was wife\nTrue to her lord, mine shall be so to me,\nHe compassed her with sweet observances\nAnd worship, never leaving her, and grew\nForgetful of his promise to the King,\nForgetful of the falcon and the hunt,\nForgetful of the tilt and tournament,\nForgetful of his glory and his name,\nForgetful of his princedom and its cares.\nAnd this forgetfulness was hateful to her.\nAnd by and by the people, when they met\nIn twos and threes, or fuller companies,\nBegan to scoff and jeer and babble of him\nAs of a prince whose manhood was all gone,\nAnd molten down in mere uxoriousness.\nAnd this she gathered from the people's eyes:\nThis too the women who attired her head,\nTo please her, dwelling on his boundless love,\nTold Enid, and they saddened her the more:\nAnd day by day she thought to tell Geraint,\nBut could not out of bashful delicacy;\nWhile he that watched her sadden, was the more\nSuspicious that her nature had a taint.\n\nAt last, it chanced that on a summer morn\n(They sleeping each by either) the new sun\nBeat through the blindless casement of the room,\nAnd heated the strong warrior in his dreams;\nWho, moving, cast the coverlet aside,\nAnd bared the knotted column of his throat,\nThe massive square of his heroic breast,\nAnd arms on which the standing muscle sloped,\nAs slopes a wild brook o'er a little stone,\nRunning too vehemently to break upon it.\nAnd Enid woke and sat beside the couch,\nAdmiring him, and thought within herself,\nWas ever man so grandly made as he?\nThen, like a shadow, past the people's talk\nAnd accusation of uxoriousness\nAcross her mind, and bowing over him,\nLow to her own heart piteously she said:\n\n'O noble breast and all-puissant arms,\nAm I the cause, I the poor cause that men\nReproach you, saying all your force is gone?\nI AM the cause, because I dare not speak\nAnd tell him what I think and what they say.\nAnd yet I hate that he should linger here;\nI cannot love my lord and not his name.\nFar liefer had I gird his harness on him,\nAnd ride with him to battle and stand by,\nAnd watch his mightful hand striking great blows\nAt caitiffs and at wrongers of the world.\nFar better were I laid in the dark earth,\nNot hearing any more his noble voice,\nNot to be folded more in these dear arms,\nAnd darkened from the high light in his eyes,\nThan that my lord through me should suffer shame.\nAm I so bold, and could I so stand by,\nAnd see my dear lord wounded in the strife,\nAnd maybe pierced to death before mine eyes,\nAnd yet not dare to tell him what I think,\nAnd how men slur him, saying all his force\nIs melted into mere effeminacy?\nO me, I fear that I am no true wife.'\n\nHalf inwardly, half audibly she spoke,\nAnd the strong passion in her made her weep\nTrue tears upon his broad and naked breast,\nAnd these awoke him, and by great mischance\nHe heard but fragments of her later words,\nAnd that she feared she was not a true wife.\nAnd then he thought, 'In spite of all my care,\nFor all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,\nShe is not faithful to me, and I see her\nWeeping for some gay knight in Arthur's hall.'\nThen though he loved and reverenced her too much\nTo dream she could be guilty of foul act,\nRight through his manful breast darted the pang\nThat makes a man, in the sweet face of her\nWhom he loves most, lonely and miserable.\nAt this he hurled his huge limbs out of bed,\nAnd shook his drowsy squire awake and cried,\n'My charger and her palfrey;' then to her,\n'I will ride forth into the wilderness;\nFor though it seems my spurs are yet to win,\nI have not fallen so low as some would wish.\nAnd thou, put on thy worst and meanest dress\nAnd ride with me.' And Enid asked, amazed,\n'If Enid errs, let Enid learn her fault.'\nBut he, 'I charge thee, ask not, but obey.'\nThen she bethought her of a faded silk,\nA faded mantle and a faded veil,\nAnd moving toward a cedarn cabinet,\nWherein she kept them folded reverently\nWith sprigs of summer laid between the folds,\nShe took them, and arrayed herself therein,\nRemembering when first he came on her\nDrest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,\nAnd all her foolish fears about the dress,\nAnd all his journey to her, as himself\nHad told her, and their coming to the court.\n\nFor Arthur on the Whitsuntide before\nHeld court at old Caerleon upon Usk.\nThere on a day, he sitting high in hall,\nBefore him came a forester of Dean,\nWet from the woods, with notice of a hart\nTaller than all his fellows, milky-white,\nFirst seen that day: these things he told the King.\nThen the good King gave order to let blow\nHis horns for hunting on the morrow morn.\nAnd when the King petitioned for his leave\nTo see the hunt, allowed it easily.\nSo with the morning all the court were gone.\nBut Guinevere lay late into the morn,\nLost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her love\nFor Lancelot, and forgetful of the hunt;\nBut rose at last, a single maiden with her,\nTook horse, and forded Usk, and gained the wood;\nThere, on a little knoll beside it, stayed\nWaiting to hear the hounds; but heard instead\nA sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,\nLate also, wearing neither hunting-dress\nNor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,\nCame quickly flashing through the shallow ford\nBehind them, and so galloped up the knoll.\nA purple scarf, at either end whereof\nThere swung an apple of the purest gold,\nSwayed round about him, as he galloped up\nTo join them, glancing like a dragon-fly\nIn summer suit and silks of holiday.\nLow bowed the tributary Prince, and she,\nSweet and statelily, and with all grace\nOf womanhood and queenhood, answered him:\n'Late, late, Sir Prince,' she said, 'later than we!'\n'Yea, noble Queen,' he answered, 'and so late\nThat I but come like you to see the hunt,\nNot join it.' 'Therefore wait with me,' she said;\n'For on this little knoll, if anywhere,\nThere is good chance that we shall hear the hounds:\nHere often they break covert at our feet.'\n\nAnd while they listened for the distant hunt,\nAnd chiefly for the baying of Cavall,\nKing Arthur's hound of deepest mouth, there rode\nFull slowly by a knight, lady, and dwarf;\nWhereof the dwarf lagged latest, and the knight\nHad vizor up, and showed a youthful face,\nImperious, and of haughtiest lineaments.\nAnd Guinevere, not mindful of his face\nIn the King's hall, desired his name, and sent\nHer maiden to demand it of the dwarf;\nWho being vicious, old and irritable,\nAnd doubling all his master's vice of pride,\nMade answer sharply that she should not know.\n'Then will I ask it of himself,' she said.\n'Nay, by my faith, thou shalt not,' cried the dwarf;\n'Thou art not worthy even to speak of him;'\nAnd when she put her horse toward the knight,\nStruck at her with his whip, and she returned\nIndignant to the Queen; whereat Geraint\nExclaiming, 'Surely I will learn the name,'\nMade sharply to the dwarf, and asked it of him,\nWho answered as before; and when the Prince\nHad put his horse in motion toward the knight,\nStruck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek.\nThe Prince's blood spirted upon the scarf,\nDyeing it; and his quick, instinctive hand\nCaught at the hilt, as to abolish him:\nBut he, from his exceeding manfulness\nAnd pure nobility of temperament,\nWroth to be wroth at such a worm, refrained\nFrom even a word, and so returning said:\n\n'I will avenge this insult, noble Queen,\nDone in your maiden's person to yourself:\nAnd I will track this vermin to their earths:\nFor though I ride unarmed, I do not doubt\nTo find, at some place I shall come at, arms\nOn loan, or else for pledge; and, being found,\nThen will I fight him, and will break his pride,\nAnd on the third day will again be here,\nSo that I be not fallen in fight. Farewell.'\n\n'Farewell, fair Prince,' answered the stately Queen.\n'Be prosperous in this journey, as in all;\nAnd may you light on all things that you love,\nAnd live to wed with her whom first you love:\nBut ere you wed with any, bring your bride,\nAnd I, were she the daughter of a king,\nYea, though she were a beggar from the hedge,\nWill clothe her for her bridals like the sun.'\n\nAnd Prince Geraint, now thinking that he heard\nThe noble hart at bay, now the far horn,\nA little vext at losing of the hunt,\nA little at the vile occasion, rode,\nBy ups and downs, through many a grassy glade\nAnd valley, with fixt eye following the three.\nAt last they issued from the world of wood,\nAnd climbed upon a fair and even ridge,\nAnd showed themselves against the sky, and sank.\nAnd thither there came Geraint, and underneath\nBeheld the long street of a little town\nIn a long valley, on one side whereof,\nWhite from the mason's hand, a fortress rose;\nAnd on one side a castle in decay,\nBeyond a bridge that spanned a dry ravine:\nAnd out of town and valley came a noise\nAs of a broad brook o'er a shingly bed\nBrawling, or like a clamour of the rooks\nAt distance, ere they settle for the night.\n\nAnd onward to the fortress rode the three,\nAnd entered, and were lost behind the walls.\n'So,' thought Geraint, 'I have tracked him to his earth.'\nAnd down the long street riding wearily,\nFound every hostel full, and everywhere\nWas hammer laid to hoof, and the hot hiss\nAnd bustling whistle of the youth who scoured\nHis master's armour; and of such a one\nHe asked, 'What means the tumult in the town?'\nWho told him, scouring still, 'The sparrow-hawk!'\nThen riding close behind an ancient churl,\nWho, smitten by the dusty sloping beam,\nWent sweating underneath a sack of corn,\nAsked yet once more what meant the hubbub here?\nWho answered gruffly, 'Ugh! the sparrow-hawk.'\nThen riding further past an armourer's,\nWho, with back turned, and bowed above his work,\nSat riveting a helmet on his knee,\nHe put the self-same query, but the man\nNot turning round, nor looking at him, said:\n'Friend, he that labours for the sparrow-hawk\nHas little time for idle questioners.'\nWhereat Geraint flashed into sudden spleen:\n'A thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk!\nTits, wrens, and all winged nothings peck him dead!\nYe think the rustic cackle of your bourg\nThe murmur of the world! What is it to me?\nO wretched set of sparrows, one and all,\nWho pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks!\nSpeak, if ye be not like the rest, hawk-mad,\nWhere can I get me harbourage for the night?\nAnd arms, arms, arms to fight my enemy? Speak!'\nWhereat the armourer turning all amazed\nAnd seeing one so gay in purple silks,\nCame forward with the helmet yet in hand\nAnd answered, 'Pardon me, O stranger knight;\nWe hold a tourney here tomorrow morn,\nAnd there is scantly time for half the work.\nArms? truth! I know not: all are wanted here.\nHarbourage? truth, good truth, I know not, save,\nIt may be, at Earl Yniol's, o'er the bridge\nYonder.' He spoke and fell to work again.\n\nThen rode Geraint, a little spleenful yet,\nAcross the bridge that spanned the dry ravine.\nThere musing sat the hoary-headed Earl,\n(His dress a suit of frayed magnificence,\nOnce fit for feasts of ceremony) and said:\n'Whither, fair son?' to whom Geraint replied,\n'O friend, I seek a harbourage for the night.'\nThen Yniol, 'Enter therefore and partake\nThe slender entertainment of a house\nOnce rich, now poor, but ever open-doored.'\n'Thanks, venerable friend,' replied Geraint;\n'So that ye do not serve me sparrow-hawks\nFor supper, I will enter, I will eat\nWith all the passion of a twelve hours' fast.'\nThen sighed and smiled the hoary-headed Earl,\nAnd answered, 'Graver cause than yours is mine\nTo curse this hedgerow thief, the sparrow-hawk:\nBut in, go in; for save yourself desire it,\nWe will not touch upon him even in jest.'\n\nThen rode Geraint into the castle court,\nHis charger trampling many a prickly star\nOf sprouted thistle on the broken stones.\nHe looked and saw that all was ruinous.\nHere stood a shattered archway plumed with fern;\nAnd here had fallen a great part of a tower,\nWhole, like a crag that tumbles from the cliff,\nAnd like a crag was gay with wilding flowers:\nAnd high above a piece of turret stair,\nWorn by the feet that now were silent, wound\nBare to the sun, and monstrous ivy-stems\nClaspt the gray walls with hairy-fibred arms,\nAnd sucked the joining of the stones, and looked\nA knot, beneath, of snakes, aloft, a grove.\n\nAnd while he waited in the castle court,\nThe voice of Enid, Yniol's daughter, rang\nClear through the open casement of the hall,\nSinging; and as the sweet voice of a bird,\nHeard by the lander in a lonely isle,\nMoves him to think what kind of bird it is\nThat sings so delicately clear, and make\nConjecture of the plumage and the form;\nSo the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint;\nAnd made him like a man abroad at morn\nWhen first the liquid note beloved of men\nComes flying over many a windy wave\nTo Britain, and in April suddenly\nBreaks from a coppice gemmed with green and red,\nAnd he suspends his converse with a friend,\nOr it may be the labour of his hands,\nTo think or say, 'There is the nightingale;'\nSo fared it with Geraint, who thought and said,\n'Here, by God's grace, is the one voice for me.'\n\nIt chanced the song that Enid sang was one\nOf Fortune and her wheel, and Enid sang:\n\n'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower the proud;\nTurn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;\nThy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.\n\n'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;\nWith that wild wheel we go not up or down;\nOur hoard is little, but our hearts are great.\n\n'Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;\nFrown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;\nFor man is man and master of his fate.\n\n'Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;\nThy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;\nThy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.'\n\n'Hark, by the bird's song ye may learn the nest,'\nSaid Yniol; 'enter quickly.' Entering then,\nRight o'er a mount of newly-fallen stones,\nThe dusky-raftered many-cobwebbed hall,\nHe found an ancient dame in dim brocade;\nAnd near her, like a blossom vermeil-white,\nThat lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath,\nMoved the fair Enid, all in faded silk,\nHer daughter. In a moment thought Geraint,\n'Here by God's rood is the one maid for me.'\nBut none spake word except the hoary Earl:\n'Enid, the good knight's horse stands in the court;\nTake him to stall, and give him corn, and then\nGo to the town and buy us flesh and wine;\nAnd we will make us merry as we may.\nOur hoard is little, but our hearts are great.'\n\nHe spake: the Prince, as Enid past him, fain\nTo follow, strode a stride, but Yniol caught\nHis purple scarf, and held, and said, 'Forbear!\nRest! the good house, though ruined, O my son,\nEndures not that her guest should serve himself.'\nAnd reverencing the custom of the house\nGeraint, from utter courtesy, forbore.\n\nSo Enid took his charger to the stall;\nAnd after went her way across the bridge,\nAnd reached the town, and while the Prince and Earl\nYet spoke together, came again with one,\nA youth, that following with a costrel bore\nThe means of goodly welcome, flesh and wine.\nAnd Enid brought sweet cakes to make them cheer,\nAnd in her veil enfolded, manchet bread.\nAnd then, because their hall must also serve\nFor kitchen, boiled the flesh, and spread the board,\nAnd stood behind, and waited on the three.\nAnd seeing her so sweet and serviceable,\nGeraint had longing in him evermore\nTo stoop and kiss the tender little thumb,\nThat crost the trencher as she laid it down:\nBut after all had eaten, then Geraint,\nFor now the wine made summer in his veins,\nLet his eye rove in following, or rest\nOn Enid at her lowly handmaid-work,\nNow here, now there, about the dusky hall;\nThen suddenly addrest the hoary Earl:\n\n'Fair Host and Earl, I pray your courtesy;\nThis sparrow-hawk, what is he? tell me of him.\nHis name? but no, good faith, I will not have it:\nFor if he be the knight whom late I saw\nRide into that new fortress by your town,\nWhite from the mason's hand, then have I sworn\nFrom his own lips to have it--I am Geraint\nOf Devon--for this morning when the Queen\nSent her own maiden to demand the name,\nHis dwarf, a vicious under-shapen thing,\nStruck at her with his whip, and she returned\nIndignant to the Queen; and then I swore\nThat I would track this caitiff to his hold,\nAnd fight and break his pride, and have it of him.\nAnd all unarmed I rode, and thought to find\nArms in your town, where all the men are mad;\nThey take the rustic murmur of their bourg\nFor the great wave that echoes round the world;\nThey would not hear me speak: but if ye know\nWhere I can light on arms, or if yourself\nShould have them, tell me, seeing I have sworn\nThat I will break his pride and learn his name,\nAvenging this great insult done the Queen.'\n\nThen cried Earl Yniol, 'Art thou he indeed,\nGeraint, a name far-sounded among men\nFor noble deeds? and truly I, when first\nI saw you moving by me on the bridge,\nFelt ye were somewhat, yea, and by your state\nAnd presence might have guessed you one of those\nThat eat in Arthur's hall in Camelot.\nNor speak I now from foolish flattery;\nFor this dear child hath often heard me praise\nYour feats of arms, and often when I paused\nHath asked again, and ever loved to hear;\nSo grateful is the noise of noble deeds\nTo noble hearts who see but acts of wrong:\nO never yet had woman such a pair\nOf suitors as this maiden: first Limours,\nA creature wholly given to brawls and wine,\nDrunk even when he wooed; and be he dead\nI know not, but he past to the wild land.\nThe second was your foe, the sparrow-hawk,\nMy curse, my nephew--I will not let his name\nSlip from my lips if I can help it--he,\nWhen that I knew him fierce and turbulent\nRefused her to him, then his pride awoke;\nAnd since the proud man often is the mean,\nHe sowed a slander in the common ear,\nAffirming that his father left him gold,\nAnd in my charge, which was not rendered to him;\nBribed with large promises the men who served\nAbout my person, the more easily\nBecause my means were somewhat broken into\nThrough open doors and hospitality;\nRaised my own town against me in the night\nBefore my Enid's birthday, sacked my house;\nFrom mine own earldom foully ousted me;\nBuilt that new fort to overawe my friends,\nFor truly there are those who love me yet;\nAnd keeps me in this ruinous castle here,\nWhere doubtless he would put me soon to death,\nBut that his pride too much despises me:\nAnd I myself sometimes despise myself;\nFor I have let men be, and have their way;\nAm much too gentle, have not used my power:\nNor know I whether I be very base\nOr very manful, whether very wise\nOr very foolish; only this I know,\nThat whatsoever evil happen to me,\nI seem to suffer nothing heart or limb,\nBut can endure it all most patiently.'\n\n'Well said, true heart,' replied Geraint, 'but arms,\nThat if the sparrow-hawk, this nephew, fight\nIn next day's tourney I may break his pride.'\n\nAnd Yniol answered, 'Arms, indeed, but old\nAnd rusty, old and rusty, Prince Geraint,\nAre mine, and therefore at thy asking, thine.\nBut in this tournament can no man tilt,\nExcept the lady he loves best be there.\nTwo forks are fixt into the meadow ground,\nAnd over these is placed a silver wand,\nAnd over that a golden sparrow-hawk,\nThe prize of beauty for the fairest there.\nAnd this, what knight soever be in field\nLays claim to for the lady at his side,\nAnd tilts with my good nephew thereupon,\nWho being apt at arms and big of bone\nHas ever won it for the lady with him,\nAnd toppling over all antagonism\nHas earned himself the name of sparrow-hawk.'\nBut thou, that hast no lady, canst not fight.'\n\nTo whom Geraint with eyes all bright replied,\nLeaning a little toward him, 'Thy leave!\nLet ME lay lance in rest, O noble host,\nFor this dear child, because I never saw,\nThough having seen all beauties of our time,\nNor can see elsewhere, anything so fair.\nAnd if I fall her name will yet remain\nUntarnished as before; but if I live,\nSo aid me Heaven when at mine uttermost,\nAs I will make her truly my true wife.'\n\nThen, howsoever patient, Yniol's heart\nDanced in his bosom, seeing better days,\nAnd looking round he saw not Enid there,\n(Who hearing her own name had stolen away)\nBut that old dame, to whom full tenderly\nAnd folding all her hand in his he said,\n'Mother, a maiden is a tender thing,\nAnd best by her that bore her understood.\nGo thou to rest, but ere thou go to rest\nTell her, and prove her heart toward the Prince.'\n\nSo spake the kindly-hearted Earl, and she\nWith frequent smile and nod departing found,\nHalf disarrayed as to her rest, the girl;\nWhom first she kissed on either cheek, and then\nOn either shining shoulder laid a hand,\nAnd kept her off and gazed upon her face,\nAnd told them all their converse in the hall,\nProving her heart: but never light and shade\nCoursed one another more on open ground\nBeneath a troubled heaven, than red and pale\nAcross the face of Enid hearing her;\nWhile slowly falling as a scale that falls,\nWhen weight is added only grain by grain,\nSank her sweet head upon her gentle breast;\nNor did she lift an eye nor speak a word,\nRapt in the fear and in the wonder of it;\nSo moving without answer to her rest\nShe found no rest, and ever failed to draw\nThe quiet night into her blood, but lay\nContemplating her own unworthiness;\nAnd when the pale and bloodless east began\nTo quicken to the sun, arose, and raised\nHer mother too, and hand in hand they moved\nDown to the meadow where the jousts were held,\nAnd waited there for Yniol and Geraint.\n\nAnd thither came the twain, and when Geraint\nBeheld her first in field, awaiting him,\nHe felt, were she the prize of bodily force,\nHimself beyond the rest pushing could move\nThe chair of Idris. Yniol's rusted arms\nWere on his princely person, but through these\nPrincelike his bearing shone; and errant knights\nAnd ladies came, and by and by the town\nFlowed in, and settling circled all the lists.\nAnd there they fixt the forks into the ground,\nAnd over these they placed the silver wand,\nAnd over that the golden sparrow-hawk.\nThen Yniol's nephew, after trumpet blown,\nSpake to the lady with him and proclaimed,\n'Advance and take, as fairest of the fair,\nWhat I these two years past have won for thee,\nThe prize of beauty.' Loudly spake the Prince,\n'Forbear: there is a worthier,' and the knight\nWith some surprise and thrice as much disdain\nTurned, and beheld the four, and all his face\nGlowed like the heart of a great fire at Yule,\nSo burnt he was with passion, crying out,\n'Do battle for it then,' no more; and thrice\nThey clashed together, and thrice they brake their spears.\nThen each, dishorsed and drawing, lashed at each\nSo often and with such blows, that all the crowd\nWondered, and now and then from distant walls\nThere came a clapping as of phantom hands.\nSo twice they fought, and twice they breathed, and still\nThe dew of their great labour, and the blood\nOf their strong bodies, flowing, drained their force.\nBut either's force was matched till Yniol's cry,\n'Remember that great insult done the Queen,'\nIncreased Geraint's, who heaved his blade aloft,\nAnd cracked the helmet through, and bit the bone,\nAnd felled him, and set foot upon his breast,\nAnd said, 'Thy name?' To whom the fallen man\nMade answer, groaning, 'Edyrn, son of Nudd!\nAshamed am I that I should tell it thee.\nMy pride is broken: men have seen my fall.'\n'Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,' replied Geraint,\n'These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest.\nFirst, thou thyself, with damsel and with dwarf,\nShalt ride to Arthur's court, and coming there,\nCrave pardon for that insult done the Queen,\nAnd shalt abide her judgment on it; next,\nThou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin.\nThese two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.'\nAnd Edyrn answered, 'These things will I do,\nFor I have never yet been overthrown,\nAnd thou hast overthrown me, and my pride\nIs broken down, for Enid sees my fall!'\nAnd rising up, he rode to Arthur's court,\nAnd there the Queen forgave him easily.\nAnd being young, he changed and came to loathe\nHis crime of traitor, slowly drew himself\nBright from his old dark life, and fell at last\nIn the great battle fighting for the King.\n\nBut when the third day from the hunting-morn\nMade a low splendour in the world, and wings\nMoved in her ivy, Enid, for she lay\nWith her fair head in the dim-yellow light,\nAmong the dancing shadows of the birds,\nWoke and bethought her of her promise given\nNo later than last eve to Prince Geraint--\nSo bent he seemed on going the third day,\nHe would not leave her, till her promise given--\nTo ride with him this morning to the court,\nAnd there be made known to the stately Queen,\nAnd there be wedded with all ceremony.\nAt this she cast her eyes upon her dress,\nAnd thought it never yet had looked so mean.\nFor as a leaf in mid-November is\nTo what it is in mid-October, seemed\nThe dress that now she looked on to the dress\nShe looked on ere the coming of Geraint.\nAnd still she looked, and still the terror grew\nOf that strange bright and dreadful thing, a court,\nAll staring at her in her faded silk:\nAnd softly to her own sweet heart she said:\n\n'This noble prince who won our earldom back,\nSo splendid in his acts and his attire,\nSweet heaven, how much I shall discredit him!\nWould he could tarry with us here awhile,\nBut being so beholden to the Prince,\nIt were but little grace in any of us,\nBent as he seemed on going this third day,\nTo seek a second favour at his hands.\nYet if he could but tarry a day or two,\nMyself would work eye dim, and finger lame,\nFar liefer than so much discredit him.'\n\nAnd Enid fell in longing for a dress\nAll branched and flowered with gold, a costly gift\nOf her good mother, given her on the night\nBefore her birthday, three sad years ago,\nThat night of fire, when Edyrn sacked their house,\nAnd scattered all they had to all the winds:\nFor while the mother showed it, and the two\nWere turning and admiring it, the work\nTo both appeared so costly, rose a cry\nThat Edyrn's men were on them, and they fled\nWith little save the jewels they had on,\nWhich being sold and sold had bought them bread:\nAnd Edyrn's men had caught them in their flight,\nAnd placed them in this ruin; and she wished\nThe Prince had found her in her ancient home;\nThen let her fancy flit across the past,\nAnd roam the goodly places that she knew;\nAnd last bethought her how she used to watch,\nNear that old home, a pool of golden carp;\nAnd one was patched and blurred and lustreless\nAmong his burnished brethren of the pool;\nAnd half asleep she made comparison\nOf that and these to her own faded self\nAnd the gay court, and fell asleep again;\nAnd dreamt herself was such a faded form\nAmong her burnished sisters of the pool;\nBut this was in the garden of a king;\nAnd though she lay dark in the pool, she knew\nThat all was bright; that all about were birds\nOf sunny plume in gilded trellis-work;\nThat all the turf was rich in plots that looked\nEach like a garnet or a turkis in it;\nAnd lords and ladies of the high court went\nIn silver tissue talking things of state;\nAnd children of the King in cloth of gold\nGlanced at the doors or gamboled down the walks;\nAnd while she thought 'They will not see me,' came\nA stately queen whose name was Guinevere,\nAnd all the children in their cloth of gold\nRan to her, crying, 'If we have fish at all\nLet them be gold; and charge the gardeners now\nTo pick the faded creature from the pool,\nAnd cast it on the mixen that it die.'\nAnd therewithal one came and seized on her,\nAnd Enid started waking, with her heart\nAll overshadowed by the foolish dream,\nAnd lo! it was her mother grasping her\nTo get her well awake; and in her hand\nA suit of bright apparel, which she laid\nFlat on the couch, and spoke exultingly:\n\n'See here, my child, how fresh the colours look,\nHow fast they hold like colours of a shell\nThat keeps the wear and polish of the wave.\nWhy not? It never yet was worn, I trow:\nLook on it, child, and tell me if ye know it.'\n\nAnd Enid looked, but all confused at first,\nCould scarce divide it from her foolish dream:\nThen suddenly she knew it and rejoiced,\nAnd answered, 'Yea, I know it; your good gift,\nSo sadly lost on that unhappy night;\nYour own good gift!' 'Yea, surely,' said the dame,\n'And gladly given again this happy morn.\nFor when the jousts were ended yesterday,\nWent Yniol through the town, and everywhere\nHe found the sack and plunder of our house\nAll scattered through the houses of the town;\nAnd gave command that all which once was ours\nShould now be ours again: and yester-eve,\nWhile ye were talking sweetly with your Prince,\nCame one with this and laid it in my hand,\nFor love or fear, or seeking favour of us,\nBecause we have our earldom back again.\nAnd yester-eve I would not tell you of it,\nBut kept it for a sweet surprise at morn.\nYea, truly is it not a sweet surprise?\nFor I myself unwillingly have worn\nMy faded suit, as you, my child, have yours,\nAnd howsoever patient, Yniol his.\nAh, dear, he took me from a goodly house,\nWith store of rich apparel, sumptuous fare,\nAnd page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal,\nAnd pastime both of hawk and hound, and all\nThat appertains to noble maintenance.\nYea, and he brought me to a goodly house;\nBut since our fortune swerved from sun to shade,\nAnd all through that young traitor, cruel need\nConstrained us, but a better time has come;\nSo clothe yourself in this, that better fits\nOur mended fortunes and a Prince's bride:\nFor though ye won the prize of fairest fair,\nAnd though I heard him call you fairest fair,\nLet never maiden think, however fair,\nShe is not fairer in new clothes than old.\nAnd should some great court-lady say, the Prince\nHath picked a ragged-robin from the hedge,\nAnd like a madman brought her to the court,\nThen were ye shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince\nTo whom we are beholden; but I know,\nThat when my dear child is set forth at her best,\nThat neither court nor country, though they sought\nThrough all the provinces like those of old\nThat lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.'\n\nHere ceased the kindly mother out of breath;\nAnd Enid listened brightening as she lay;\nThen, as the white and glittering star of morn\nParts from a bank of snow, and by and by\nSlips into golden cloud, the maiden rose,\nAnd left her maiden couch, and robed herself,\nHelped by the mother's careful hand and eye,\nWithout a mirror, in the gorgeous gown;\nWho, after, turned her daughter round, and said,\nShe never yet had seen her half so fair;\nAnd called her like that maiden in the tale,\nWhom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers\nAnd sweeter than the bride of Cassivelaun,\nFlur, for whose love the Roman Csar first\nInvaded Britain, 'But we beat him back,\nAs this great Prince invaded us, and we,\nNot beat him back, but welcomed him with joy\nAnd I can scarcely ride with you to court,\nFor old am I, and rough the ways and wild;\nBut Yniol goes, and I full oft shall dream\nI see my princess as I see her now,\nClothed with my gift, and gay among the gay.'\n\nBut while the women thus rejoiced, Geraint\nWoke where he slept in the high hall, and called\nFor Enid, and when Yniol made report\nOf that good mother making Enid gay\nIn such apparel as might well beseem\nHis princess, or indeed the stately Queen,\nHe answered: 'Earl, entreat her by my love,\nAlbeit I give no reason but my wish,\nThat she ride with me in her faded silk.'\nYniol with that hard message went; it fell\nLike flaws in summer laying lusty corn:\nFor Enid, all abashed she knew not why,\nDared not to glance at her good mother's face,\nBut silently, in all obedience,\nHer mother silent too, nor helping her,\nLaid from her limbs the costly-broidered gift,\nAnd robed them in her ancient suit again,\nAnd so descended. Never man rejoiced\nMore than Geraint to greet her thus attired;\nAnd glancing all at once as keenly at her\nAs careful robins eye the delver's toil,\nMade her cheek burn and either eyelid fall,\nBut rested with her sweet face satisfied;\nThen seeing cloud upon the mother's brow,\nHer by both hands she caught, and sweetly said,\n\n'O my new mother, be not wroth or grieved\nAt thy new son, for my petition to her.\nWhen late I left Caerleon, our great Queen,\nIn words whose echo lasts, they were so sweet,\nMade promise, that whatever bride I brought,\nHerself would clothe her like the sun in Heaven.\nThereafter, when I reached this ruined hall,\nBeholding one so bright in dark estate,\nI vowed that could I gain her, our fair Queen,\nNo hand but hers, should make your Enid burst\nSunlike from cloud--and likewise thought perhaps,\nThat service done so graciously would bind\nThe two together; fain I would the two\nShould love each other: how can Enid find\nA nobler friend? Another thought was mine;\nI came among you here so suddenly,\nThat though her gentle presence at the lists\nMight well have served for proof that I was loved,\nI doubted whether daughter's tenderness,\nOr easy nature, might not let itself\nBe moulded by your wishes for her weal;\nOr whether some false sense in her own self\nOf my contrasting brightness, overbore\nHer fancy dwelling in this dusky hall;\nAnd such a sense might make her long for court\nAnd all its perilous glories: and I thought,\nThat could I someway prove such force in her\nLinked with such love for me, that at a word\n(No reason given her) she could cast aside\nA splendour dear to women, new to her,\nAnd therefore dearer; or if not so new,\nYet therefore tenfold dearer by the power\nOf intermitted usage; then I felt\nThat I could rest, a rock in ebbs and flows,\nFixt on her faith. Now, therefore, I do rest,\nA prophet certain of my prophecy,\nThat never shadow of mistrust can cross\nBetween us. Grant me pardon for my thoughts:\nAnd for my strange petition I will make\nAmends hereafter by some gaudy-day,\nWhen your fair child shall wear your costly gift\nBeside your own warm hearth, with, on her knees,\nWho knows? another gift of the high God,\nWhich, maybe, shall have learned to lisp you thanks.'\n\nHe spoke: the mother smiled, but half in tears,\nThen brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it,\nAnd claspt and kissed her, and they rode away.\n\nNow thrice that morning Guinevere had climbed\nThe giant tower, from whose high crest, they say,\nMen saw the goodly hills of Somerset,\nAnd white sails flying on the yellow sea;\nBut not to goodly hill or yellow sea\nLooked the fair Queen, but up the vale of Usk,\nBy the flat meadow, till she saw them come;\nAnd then descending met them at the gates,\nEmbraced her with all welcome as a friend,\nAnd did her honour as the Prince's bride,\nAnd clothed her for her bridals like the sun;\nAnd all that week was old Caerleon gay,\nFor by the hands of Dubric, the high saint,\nThey twain were wedded with all ceremony.\n\nAnd this was on the last year's Whitsuntide.\nBut Enid ever kept the faded silk,\nRemembering how first he came on her,\nDrest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,\nAnd all her foolish fears about the dress,\nAnd all his journey toward her, as himself\nHad told her, and their coming to the court.\n\nAnd now this morning when he said to her,\n'Put on your worst and meanest dress,' she found\nAnd took it, and arrayed herself therein.","title":"The Marriage Of Geraint"},{"lines":"Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm;\nAnd in the chasm are foam and yellow sands;\nBeyond, red roofs about a narrow wharf\nIn cluster; then a moulder'd church; and higher\nA long street climbs to one tall-tower'd mill;\nAnd high in heaven behind it a gray down\nWith Danish barrows; and a hazelwood,\nBy autumn nutters haunted, flourishes\nGreen in a cuplike hollow of the down.\n\nHere on this beach a hundred years ago,\nThree children of three houses, Annie Lee,\nThe prettiest little damsel in the port,\nAnd Philip Ray the miller's only son,\nAnd Enoch Arden, a rough sailor's lad\nMade orphan by a winter shipwreck, play'd\nAmong the waste and lumber of the shore,\nHard coils of cordage, swarthy fishing-nets,\nAnchors of rusty fluke, and boats updrawn,\nAnd built their castles of dissolving sand\nTo watch them overflow'd, or following up\nAnd flying the white breaker, daily left\nThe little footprint daily wash'd away.\n\nA narrow cave ran in beneath the cliff:\nIn this the children play'd at keeping house.\nEnoch was host one day, Philip the next,\nWhile Annie still was mistress; but at times\nEnoch would hold possession for a week:\n`This is my house and this my little wife.'\n`Mine too' said Philip `turn and turn about:'\nWhen, if they quarrell'd, Enoch stronger-made\nWas master: then would Philip, his blue eyes\nAll flooded with the helpless wrath of tears,\nShriek out `I hate you, Enoch,' and at this\nThe little wife would weep for company,\nAnd pray them not to quarrel for her sake,\nAnd say she would be little wife to both.\n\nBut when the dawn of rosy childhood past,\nAnd the new warmth of life's ascending sun\nWas felt by either, either fixt his heart\nOn that one girl; and Enoch spoke his love,\nBut Philip loved in silence; and the girl\nSeem'd kinder unto Philip than to him;\nBut she loved Enoch; tho' she knew it not,\nAnd would if ask'd deny it. Enoch set\nA purpose evermore before his eyes,\nTo hoard all savings to the uttermost,\nTo purchase his own boat, and make a home\nFor Annie: and so prosper'd that at last\nA luckier or a bolder fisherman,\nA carefuller in peril, did not breathe\nFor leagues along that breaker-beaten coast\nThan Enoch. Likewise had he served a year\nOn board a merchantman, and made himself\nFull sailor; and he thrice had pluck'd a life\nFrom the dread sweep of the down-streaming seas:\nAnd all me look'd upon him favorably:\nAnd ere he touch'd his one-and-twentieth May\nHe purchased his own boat, and made a home\nFor Annie, neat and nestlike, halfway up\nThe narrow street that clamber'd toward the mill.\n\nThen, on a golden autumn eventide,\nThe younger people making holiday,\nWith bag and sack and basket, great and small,\nWent nutting to the hazels. Philip stay'd\n(His father lying sick and needing him)\nAn hour behind; but as he climb'd the hill,\nJust where the prone edge of the wood began\nTo feather toward the hollow, saw the pair,\nEnoch and Annie, sitting hand-in-hand,\nHis large gray eyes and weather-beaten face\nAll-kindled by a still and sacred fire,\nThat burn'd as on an altar. Philip look'd,\nAnd in their eyes and faces read his doom;\nThen, as their faces drew together, groan'd,\nAnd slipt aside, and like a wounded life\nCrept down into the hollows of the wood;\nThere, while the rest were loud in merrymaking,\nHad his dark hour unseen, and rose and past\nBearing a lifelong hunger in his heart.\n\nSo these were wed, and merrily rang the bells,\nAnd merrily ran the years, seven happy years,\nSeven happy years of health and competence,\nAnd mutual love and honorable toil;\nWith children; first a daughter. In him woke,\nWith his first babe's first cry, the noble wish\nTo save all earnings to the uttermost,\nAnd give his child a better bringing-up\nThan his had been, or hers; a wish renew'd,\nWhen two years after came a boy to be\nThe rosy idol of her solitudes,\nWhile Enoch was abroad on wrathful seas,\nOr often journeying landward; for in truth\nEnoch's white horse, and Enoch's ocean-spoil\nIn ocean-smelling osier, and his face,\nRough-redden'd with a thousand winter gales,\nNot only to the market-cross were known,\nBut in the leafy lanes behind the down,\nFar as the portal-warding lion-whelp,\nAnd peacock-yewtree of the lonely Hall,\nWhose Friday fare was Enoch's ministering.\n\nThen came a change, as all things human change.\nTen miles to northward of the narrow port\nOpen'd a larger haven: thither used\nEnoch at times to go by land or sea;\nAnd once when there, and clambering on a mast\nIn harbor, by mischance he slipt and fell:\nA limb was broken when they lifted him;\nAnd while he lay recovering there, his wife\nBore him another son, a sickly one:\nAnother hand crept too across his trade\nTaking her bread and theirs: and on him fell,\nAltho' a grave and staid God-fearing man,\nYet lying thus inactive, doubt and gloom.\nHe seem'd, as in a nightmare of the night,\nTo see his children leading evermore\nLow miserable lives of hand-to-mouth,\nAnd her, he loved, a beggar: then he pray'd\n`Save them from this, whatever comes to me.'\nAnd while he pray'd, the master of that ship\nEnoch had served in, hearing his mischance,\nCame, for he knew the man and valued him,\nReporting of his vessel China-bound,\nAnd wanting yet a boatswain. Would he go?\nThere yet were many weeks before she sail'd,\nSail'd from this port. Would Enoch have the place?\nAnd Enoch all at once assented to it,\nRejoicing at that answer to his prayer.\n\nSo now that the shadow of mischance appear'd\nNo graver than as when some little cloud\nCuts off the fiery highway of the sun,\nAnd isles a light in the offing: yet the wife--\nWhen he was gone--the children--what to do?\nThen Enoch lay long-pondering on his plans;\nTo sell the boat--and yet he loved her well--\nHow many a rough sea had he weather'd in her!\nHe knew her, as a horseman knows his horse--\nAnd yet to sell her--then with what she brought\nBuy goods and stores--set Annie forth in trade\nWith all that seamen needed or their wives--\nSo might she keep the house while he was gone.\nShould he not trade himself out yonder? go\nThis voyage more than once? yea twice or thrice--\nAs oft as needed--last, returning rich,\nBecome the master of a larger craft,\nWith fuller profits lead an easier life,\nHave all his pretty young ones educated,\nAnd pass his days in peace among his own.\n\nThus Enoch in his heart determined all:\nThen moving homeward came on Annie pale,\nNursing the sickly babe, her latest-born.\nForward she started with a happy cry,\nAnd laid the feeble infant in his arms;\nWhom Enoch took, and handled all his limbs,\nAppraised his weight and fondled fatherlike,\nBut had no heart to break his purposes\nTo Annie, till the morrow, when he spoke.\n\nThen first since Enoch's golden ring had girt\nHer finger, Annie fought against his will:\nYet not with brawling opposition she,\nBut manifold entreaties, many a tear,\nMany a sad kiss by day and night renew'd\n(Sure that all evil would come out of it)\nBesought him, supplicating, if he cared\nFor here or his dear children, not to go.\nHe not for his own self caring but her,\nHer and her children, let her plead in vain;\nSo grieving held his will, and bore it thro'.\n\nFor Enoch parted with his old sea-friend,\nBought Annie goods and stores, and set his hand\nTo fit their little streetward sitting-room\nWith shelf and corner for the goods and stores.\nSo all day long till Enoch's last at home,\nShaking their pretty cabin, hammer and axe,\nAuger and saw, while Annie seem'd to hear\nHer own death-scaffold raising, shrill'd and rang,\nTill this was ended, and his careful hand,--\nThe space was narrow,--having order'd all\nAlmost as neat and close as Nature packs\nHer blossom or her seedling, paused; and he,\nWho needs would work for Annie to the last,\nAscending tired, heavily slept till morn.\n\nAnd Enoch faced this morning of farewell\nBrightly and boldly. All his Annie's fears,\nSave, as his Annie's, were a laughter to him.\nYet Enoch as a brave God-fearing man\nBow'd himself down, and in that mystery\nWhere God-in-man is one with man-in-God,\nPray'd for a blessing on his wife and babes\nWhatever came to him: and then he said\n`Annie, this voyage by the grace of God\nWill bring fair weather yet to all of us.\nKeep a clean hearth and a clear fire for me,\nFor I'll be back, my girl, before you know it.'\nThen lightly rocking baby's cradle `and he,\nThis pretty, puny, weakly little one,--\nNay--for I love him all the better for it--\nGod bless him, he shall sit upon my knees\nAnd I will tell him tales of foreign parts,\nAnd make him merry, when I come home again.\nCome Annie, come, cheer up before I go.'\n\nHim running on thus hopefully she heard,\nAnd almost hoped herself; but when he turn'd\nThe current of his talk to graver things\nIn sailor fashion roughly sermonizing\nOn providence and trust in Heaven, she heard,\nHeard and not heard him; as the village girl,\nWho sets her pitcher underneath the spring,\nMusing on him that used to fill it for her,\nHears and not hears, and lets it overflow.\n\nAt length she spoke `O Enoch, you are wise;\nAnd yet for all your wisdom well know I\nThat I shall look upon your face no more.'\n\n`Well then,' said Enoch, `I shall look on yours.\nAnnie, the ship I sail in passes here\n(He named the day) get you a seaman's glass,\nSpy out my face, and laugh at all your fears.'\n\nBut when the last of those last moments came,\n`Annie my girl, cheer up, be comforted,\nLook to the babes, and till I come again,\nKeep everything shipshape, for I must go.\nAnd fear no more for me; or if you fear\nCast all your cares on God; that anchor holds.\nIs He not yonder in those uttermost\nParts of the morning? if I flee to these\nCan I go from Him? and the sea is His,\nThe sea is His: He made it.'\n\nEnoch rose,\nCast his strong arms about his drooping wife,\nAnd kiss'd his wonder-stricken little ones;\nBut for the third, sickly one, who slept\nAfter a night of feverous wakefulness,\nWhen Annie would have raised him Enoch said\n`Wake him not; let him sleep; how should this child\nRemember this?' and kiss'ed him in his cot.\nBut Annie from her baby's forehead clipt\nA tiny curl, and gave it: this he kept\nThro' all his future; but now hastily caught\nHis bundle, waved his hand, and went his way.\n\nShe when the day, that Enoch mention'd, came,\nBorrow'd a glass, but all in vain: perhaps\nShe could not fix the glass to suit her eye;\nPerhaps her eye was dim, hand tremulous;\nShe saw him not: and while he stood on deck\nWaving, the moment and the vessel past.\n\nEv'n to the last dip of the vanishing sail\nShe watch'd it, and departed weeping for him;\nThen, tho' she mourn'd his absence as his grave,\nSet her sad will no less to chime with his,\nBut throve not in her trade, not being bred\nTo barter, nor compensating the want\nBy shrewdness, neither capable of lies,\nNor asking overmuch and taking less,\nAnd still foreboding `what would Enoch say?'\nFor more than once, in days of difficulty\nAnd pressure, had she sold her wares for less\nThan what she gave in buying what she sold:\nShe fail'd and sadden'd knowing it; and thus,\nExpectant of that news that never came,\nGain'd for here own a scanty sustenance,\nAnd lived a life of silent melancholy.\n\nNow the third child was sickly-born and grew\nYet sicklier, tho' the mother cared for it\nWith all a mother's care: nevertheless,\nWhether her business often call'd her from it,\nOr thro' the want of what it needed most,\nOr means to pay the voice who best could tell\nWhat most it needed--howsoe'er it was,\nAfter a lingering,--ere she was aware,--\nLike the caged bird escaping suddenly,\nThe little innocent soul flitted away.\n\nIn that same week when Annie buried it,\nPhilip's true heart, which hunger'd for her peace\n(Since Enoch left he had not look'd upon her),\nSmote him, as having kept aloof so long.\n`Surely' said Philip `I may see her now,\nMay be some little comfort;' therefore went,\nPast thro' the solitary room in front,\nPaused for a moment at an inner door,\nThen struck it thrice, and, no one opening,\nEnter'd; but Annie, seated with her grief,\nFresh from the burial of her little one,\nCared not to look on any human face,\nBut turn'd her own toward the wall and wept.\nThen Philip standing up said falteringly\n`Annie, I came to ask a favor of you.'\n\nHe spoke; the passion in her moan'd reply\n`Favor from one so sad and so forlorn\nAs I am!' half abash'd him; yet unask'd,\nHis bashfulness and tenderness at war,\nHe set himself beside her, saying to her:\n\n`I came to speak to you of what he wish'd,\nEnoch, your husband: I have ever said\nYou chose the best among us--a strong man:\nFor where he fixt his heart he set his hand\nTo do the thing he will'd, and bore it thro'.\nAnd wherefore did he go this weary way,\nAnd leave you lonely? not to see the world--\nFor pleasure?--nay, but for the wherewithal\nTo give his babes a better bringing-up\nThan his had been, or yours: that was his wish.\nAnd if he come again, vext will he be\nTo find the precious morning hours were lost.\nAnd it would vex him even in his grave,\nIf he could know his babes were running wild\nLike colts about the waste. So Annie, now--\nHave we not known each other all our lives?\nI do beseech you by the love you bear\nHim and his children not to say me nay--\nFor, if you will, when Enoch comes again\nWhy then he shall repay me--if you will,\nAnnie--for I am rich and well-to-do.\nNow let me put the boy and girl to school:\nThis is the favor that I came to ask.'\n\nThen Annie with her brows against the wall\nAnswer'd `I cannot look you in the face;\nI seem so foolish and so broken down.\nWhen you came in my sorrow broke me down;\nAnd now I think your kindness breaks me down;\nBut Enoch lives; that is borne in on me:\nHe will repay you: money can be repaid;\nNot kindness such as yours.'\n\nAnd Philip ask'd\n`Then you will let me, Annie?'\n\nThere she turn'd,\nShe rose, and fixt her swimming eyes upon him,\nAnd dwelt a moment on his kindly face,\nThen calling down a blessing on his head\nCaught at his hand and wrung it passionately,\nAnd past into the little garth beyond.\nSo lifted up in spirit he moved away.\n\nThen Philip put the boy and girl to school,\nAnd bought them needful books, and everyway,\nLike one who does his duty by his own,\nMade himself theirs; and tho' for Annie's sake,\nFearing the lazy gossip of the port,\nHe oft denied his heart his dearest wish,\nAnd seldom crost her threshold, yet he sent\nGifts by the children, garden-herbs and fruit,\nThe late and early roses from his wall,\nOr conies from the down, and now and then,\nWith some pretext of fineness in the meal\nTo save the offence of charitable, flour\nFrom his tall mill that whistled on the waste.\n\nBut Philip did not fathom Annie's mind:\nScarce could the woman when he came upon her,\nOut of full heart and boundless gratitude\nLight on a broken word to thank him with.\nBut Philip was her children's all-in-all;\nFrom distant corners of the street they ran\nTo greet his hearty welcome heartily;\nLords of his house and of his mill were they;\nWorried his passive ear with petty wrongs\nOr pleasures, hung upon him, play'd with him\nAnd call'd him Father Philip. Philip gain'd\nAs Enoch lost; for Enoch seem'd to them\nUncertain as a vision or a dream,\nFaint as a figure seen in early dawn\nDown at the far end of an avenue,\nGoing we know not where: and so ten years,\nSince Enoch left his hearth and native land,\nFled forward, and no news of Enoch came.\n\nIt chanced one evening Annie's children long'd\nTo go with others, nutting to the wood,\nAnd Annie would go with them; then they begg'd\nFor Father Philip (as they call'd him) too:\nHim, like the working bee in blossom-dust,\nBlanch'd with his mill, they found; and saying to him\n`Come with us Father Philip' he denied;\nBut when the children pluck'd at him to go,\nHe laugh'd, and yielding readily to their wish,\nFor was not Annie with them? and they went.\n\nBut after scaling half the weary down,\nJust where the prone edge of the wood began\nTo feather toward the hollow, all her force\nFail'd her; and sighing `let me rest' she said.\nSo Philip rested with her well-content;\nWhile all the younger ones with jubilant cries\nBroke from their elders, and tumultuously\nDown thro' the whitening hazels made a plunge\nTo the bottom, and dispersed, and beat or broke\nThe lithe reluctant boughs to tear away\nTheir tawny clusters, crying to each other\nAnd calling, here and there, about the wood.\n\nBut Philip sitting at her side forgot\nHer presence, and remember'd one dark hour\nHere in this wood, when like a wounded life\nHe crept into the shadow: at last he said\nLifting his honest forehead `Listen, Annie,\nHow merry they are down yonder in the wood.'\n`Tired, Annie?' for she did not speak a word.\n`Tired?' but her face had fall'n upon her hands;\nAt which, as with a kind anger in him,\n`The ship was lost' he said `the ship was lost!\nNo more of that! why should you kill yourself\nAnd make them orphans quite?' And Annie said\n`I thought not of it: but--I known not why--\nTheir voices make me feel so solitary.'\n\nThen Philip coming somewhat closer spoke.\n`Annie, there is a thing upon my mind,\nAnd it has been upon my mind so long,\nThat tho' I know not when it first came there,\nI know that it will out at last. O Annie,\nIt is beyond all hope, against all chance,\nThat he who left you ten long years ago\nShould still be living; well then--let me speak:\nI grieve to see you poor and wanting help:\nI cannot help you as I wish to do\nUnless--they say that women are so quick--\nPerhaps you know what I would have you know--\nI wish you for my wife. I fain would prove\nA father to your children: I do think\nThey love me as a father: I am sure\nThat I love them as if they were mine own;\nAnd I believe, if you were fast my wife,\nThat after all these sad uncertain years,\nWe might be still as happy as God grants\nTo any of His creatures. Think upon it:\nFor I am well-to-do--no kin, no care,\nNo burthen, save my care for you and yours:\nAnd we have known each other all our lives,\nAnd I have loved you longer than you know.'\n\nThen answer'd Annie; tenderly she spoke:\n`You have been as God's good angel in our house.\nGod bless you for it, God reward you for it,\nPhilip, with something happier than myself.\nCan one live twice? can you be ever loved\nAs Enoch was? what is it that you ask?'\n`I am content' he answer'd `to be loved\nA little after Enoch.' `O' she cried\nScared as it were `dear Philip, wait a while:\nIf Enoch comes--but Enoch will not come--\nYet wait a year, a year is not so long:\nSurely I shall be wiser in a year:\nO wait a little!' Philip sadly said\n`Annie, as I have waited all my life\nI well may wait a little.' `Nay' she cried\n`I am bound: you have my promise--in a year:\nWill you not bide your year as I bide mine?'\nAnd Philip answer'd `I will bide my year.'\n\nHere both were mute, till Philip glancing up\nBeheld the dead flame of the fallen day\nPass from the Danish barrow overhead;\nThen fearing night and chill for Annie rose,\nAnd sent his voice beneath him thro' the wood.\nUp came the children laden with their spoil;\nThen all descended to the port, and there\nAt Annie's door he paused and gave his hand,\nSaying gently `Annie, when I spoke to you,\nThat was your hour of weakness. I was wrong.\nI am always bound to you, but you are free.'\nThen Annie weeping answer'd `I am bound.'\n\nShe spoke; and in one moment as it were,\nWhile yet she went about her household ways,\nEv'n as she dwelt upon his latest words,\nThat he had loved her longer than she knew,\nThat autumn into autumn flash'd again,\nAnd there he stood once more before her face,\nClaiming her promise. `Is it a year?' she ask'd.\n`Yes, if the nuts' he said `be ripe again:\nCome out and see.' But she--she put him off--\nSo much to look to--such a change--a month--\nGive her a month--she knew that she was bound--\nA month--no more. Then Philip with his eyes\nFull of that lifelong hunger, and his voice\nShaking a little like a drunkard's hand,\n`Take your own time, Annie, take your own time.'\nAnd Annie could have wept for pity of him;\nAnd yet she held him on delayingly\nWith many a scarce-believable excuse,\nTrying his truth and his long-sufferance,\nTill half-another year had slipt away.\n\nBy this the lazy gossips of the port,\nAbhorrent of a calculation crost,\nBegan to chafe as at a personal wrong.\nSome thought that Philip did but trifle with her;\nSome that she but held off to draw him on;\nAnd others laugh'd at her and Philip too,\nAs simple folks that knew not their own minds;\nAnd one, in whom all evil fancies clung\nLike serpent eggs together, laughingly\nWould hint a worse in either. Her own son\nWas silent, tho' he often look'd his wish;\nBut evermore the daughter prest upon her\nTo wed the man so dear to all of them\nAnd lift the household out of poverty;\nAnd Philip's rosy face contracting grew\nCareworn and wan; and all these things fell on her\nSharp as reproach.\n\nAt last one night it chanced\nThat Annie could not sleep, but earnestly\nPray'd for a sign `my Enoch is he gone?'\nThen compass'd round by the blind wall of night\nBrook'd not the expectant terror of her heart,\nStarted from bed, and struck herself a light,\nThen desperately seized the holy Book,\nSuddenly set it wide to find a sign,\nSuddenly put her finger on the text,\n`Under a palmtree.' That was nothing to her:\nNo meaning there: she closed the book and slept:\nWhen lo! her Enoch sitting on a height,\nUnder a palmtree, over him the Sun:\n`He is gone' she thought `he is happy, he is singing\nHosanna in the highest: yonder shines\nThe Sun of Righteousness, and these be palms\nWhereof the happy people strowing cried\n\"Hosanna in the highest!\"' Here she woke,\nResolved, sent for him and said wildly to him\n`There is no reason why we should not wed.'\n`Then for God's sake,' he answer'd, `both our sakes,\nSo you will wed me, let it be at once.'\n\nSo these were wed and merrily rang the bells,\nMerrily rang the bells and they were wed.\nBut never merrily beat Annie's heart.\nA footstep seem'd to fall beside her path,\nShe knew not whence; a whisper in her ear,\nShe knew not what; nor loved she to be left\nAlone at home, nor ventured out alone.\nWhat ail'd her then, that ere she enter'd, often\nHer hand dwelt lingeringly on the latch,\nFearing to enter: Philip thought he knew:\nSuch doubts and fears were common to her state,\nBeing with child: but when her child was born,\nThen her new child was as herself renew'd,\nThen the new mother came about her heart,\nThen her good Philip was her all-in-all,\nAnd that mysterious instinct wholly died.\n\nAnd where was Enoch? prosperously sail'd\nThe ship `Good Fortune,' tho' at setting forth\nThe Biscay, roughly ridging eastward, shook\nAnd almost overwhelm'd her, yet unvext\nShe slipt across the summer of the world,\nThen after a long tumble about the Cape\nAnd frequent interchange of foul and fair,\nShe passing thro' the summer world again,\nThe breath of heaven came continually\nAnd sent her sweetly by the golden isles,\nTill silent in her oriental haven.\n\nThere Enoch traded for himself, and bought\nQuaint monsters for the market of those times,\nA gilded dragon, also, for the babes.\n\nLess lucky her home-voyage: at first indeed\nThro' many a fair sea-circle, day by day,\nScarce-rocking, her full-busted figure-head\nStared o'er the ripple feathering from her bows:\nThen follow'd calms, and then winds variable,\nThen baffling, a long course of them; and last\nStorm, such as drove her under moonless heavens\nTill hard upon the cry of `breakers' came\nThe crash of ruin, and the loss of all\nBut Enoch and two others. Half the night,\nBuoy'd upon floating tackle and broken spars,\nThese drifted, stranding on an isle at morn\nRich, but loneliest in a lonely sea.\n\nNo want was there of human sustenance,\nSoft fruitage, mighty nuts, and nourishing roots;\nNor save for pity was it hard to take\nThe helpless life so wild that it was tame.\nThere in a seaward-gazing mountain-gorge\nThey built, and thatch'd with leaves of palm, a hut,\nHalf hut, half native cavern. So the three,\nSet in this Eden of all plenteousness,\nDwelt with eternal summer, ill-content.\n\nFor one, the youngest, hardly more than boy,\nHurt in that night of sudden ruin and wreck,\nLay lingering out a three-years' death-in-life.\nThey could not leave him. After he was gone,\nThe two remaining found a fallen stem;\nAnd Enoch's comrade, careless of himself,\nFire-hollowing this in Indian fashion, fell\nSun-stricken, and that other lived alone.\nIn those two deaths he read God's warning `wait.'\n\nThe mountain wooded to the peak, the lawns\nAnd winding glades high up like ways to Heaven,\nThe slender coco's drooping crown of plumes,\nThe lightning flash of insect and of bird,\nThe lustre of the long convolvuluses\nThat coil'd around the stately stems, and ran\nEv'n to the limit of the land, the glows\nAnd glories of the broad belt of the world,\nAll these he saw; but what he fain had seen\nHe could not see, the kindly human face,\nNor ever hear a kindly voice, but heard\nThe myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl,\nThe league-long roller thundering on the reef,\nThe moving whisper of huge trees that branch'd\nAnd blossom'd in the zenith, or the sweep\nOf some precipitous rivulet to the wave,\nAs down the shore he ranged, or all day long\nSat often in the seaward-gazing gorge,\nA shipwreck'd sailor, waiting for a sail:\nNo sail from day to day, but every day\nThe sunrise broken into scarlet shafts\nAmong the palms and ferns and precipices;\nThe blaze upon the waters to the east;\nThe blaze upon his island overhead;\nThe blaze upon the waters to the west;\nThen the great stars that globed themselves in Heaven,\nThe hollower-bellowing ocean, and again\nThe scarlet shafts of sunrise--but no sail.\n\nThere often as he watch'd or seem'd to watch,\nSo still, the golden lizard on him paused,\nA phantom made of many phantoms moved\nBefore him haunting him, or he himself\nMoved haunting people, things and places, known\nFar in a darker isle beyond the line;\nThe babes, their babble, Annie, the small house,\nThe climbing street, the mill, the leafy lanes,\nThe peacock-yewtree and the lonely Hall,\nThe horse he drove, the boat he sold, the chill\nNovember dawns and dewy-glooming downs,\nThe gentle shower, the smell of dying leaves,\nAnd the low moan of leaden-color'd seas.\n\nOnce likewise, in the ringing of his ears,\nTho' faintly, merrily--far and far away--\nHe heard the pealing of his parish bells;\nThen, tho' he knew not wherefore, started up\nShuddering, and when the beauteous hateful isle\nReturn'd upon him, had not his poor heart\nSpoken with That, which being everywhere\nLets none, who speaks with Him, seem all alone,\nSurely the man had died of solitude.\n\nThus over Enoch's early-silvering head\nThe sunny and rainy seasons came and went\nYear after year. His hopes to see his own,\nAnd pace the sacred old familiar fields,\nNot yet had perish'd, when his lonely doom\nCame suddenly to an end. Another ship\n(She wanted water) blown by baffling winds,\nLike the Good Fortune, from her destined course,\nStay'd by this isle, not knowing where she lay:\nFor since the mate had seen at early dawn\nAcross a break on the mist-wreathen isle\nThe silent water slipping from the hills,\nThey sent a crew that landing burst away\nIn search of stream or fount, and fill'd the shores\nWith clamor. Downward from his mountain gorge\nStept the long-hair'd long-bearded solitary,\nBrown, looking hardly human, strangely clad,\nMuttering and mumbling, idiotlike it seem'd,\nWith inarticulate rage, and making signs\nThey knew not what: and yet he led the way\nTo where the rivulets of sweet water ran;\nAnd ever as he mingled with the crew,\nAnd heard them talking, his long-bounden tongue\nWas loosen'd, till he made them understand;\nWhom, when their casks were fill'd they took aboard:\nAnd there the tale he utter'd brokenly,\nScarce credited at first but more and more,\nAmazed and melted all who listen'd to it:\nAnd clothes they gave him and free passage home;\nBut oft he work'd among the rest and shook\nHis isolation from him. None of these\nCame from his county, or could answer him,\nIf question'd, aught of what he cared to know.\nAnd dull the voyage was with long delays,\nThe vessel scarce sea-worthy; but evermore\nHis fancy fled before the lazy wind\nReturning, till beneath a clouded moon\nHe like a lover down thro' all his blood\nDrew in the dewy meadowy morning-breath\nOf England, blown across her ghostly wall:\nAnd that same morning officers and men\nLevied a kindly tax upon themselves,\nPitying the lonely man, and gave him it:\nThen moving up the coast they landed him,\nEv'n in that harbor whence he sail'd before.\n\nThere Enoch spoke no word to anyone,\nBut homeward--home--what home? had he a home?\nHis home, he walk'd. Bright was that afternoon,\nSunny but chill; till drawn thro' either chasm,\nWhere either haven open'd on the deeps,\nRoll'd a sea-haze and whelm'd the world in gray;\nCut off the length of highway on before,\nAnd left but narrow breadth to left and right\nOf wither'd holt or tilth or pasturage.\nOn the nigh-naked tree the Robin piped\nDisconsolate, and thro' the dripping haze\nThe dead weight of the dead leaf bore it down.\nThicker the drizzle grew, deeper the gloom;\nLast, as it seem'd, a great mist-blotted light\nFlared on him, and he came upon the place.\n\nThen down the long street having slowly stolen,\nHis heart foreshadowing all calamity,\nHis eyes upon the stones, he reach'd the home\nWhere Annie lived and loved him, and his babes\nIn those far-off seven happy years were born;\nBut finding neither light nor murmur there\n(A bill of sale gleam'd thro' the drizzle) crept\nStill downward thinking `dead or dead to me!'\n\nDown to the pool and narrow wharf he went,\nSeeking a tavern which of old he knew,\nA front of timber-crost antiquity,\nSo propt, worm-eaten, ruinously old,\nHe thought it must have gone; but he was gone\nWho kept it; and his widow, Miriam Lane,\nWith daily-dwindling profits held the house;\nA haunt of brawling seamen once, but now\nStiller, with yet a bed for wandering men.\nThere Enoch rested silently many days.\n\nBut Miriam Lane was good and garrulous,\nNor let him be, but often breaking in,\nTold him, with other annals of the port,\nNot knowing--Enoch was so brown, so bow'd,\nSo broken--all the story of his house.\nHis baby's death, her growing poverty,\nHow Philip put her little ones to school,\nAnd kept them in it, his long wooing her,\nHer slow consent, and marriage, and the birth\nOf Philip's child: and o'er his countenance\nNo shadow past, nor motion: anyone,\nRegarding, well had deem'd he felt the tale\nLess than the teller: only when she closed\n`Enoch, poor man, was cast away and lost'\nHe, shaking his gray head pathetically,\nRepeated muttering `cast away and lost;'\nAgain in deeper inward whispers `lost!'\n\nBut Enoch yearn'd to see her face again;\n`If I might look on her sweet face gain\nAnd know that she is happy.' So the thought\nHaunted and harass'd him, and drove him forth,\nAt evening when the dull November day\nWas growing duller twilight, to the hill.\nThere he sat down gazing on all below;\nThere did a thousand memories roll upon him,\nUnspeakable for sadness. By and by\nThe ruddy square of comfortable light,\nFar-blazing from the rear of Philip's house,\nAllured him, as the beacon-blaze allures\nThe bird of passage, till he madly strikes\nAgainst it, and beats out his weary life.\n\nFor Philip's dwelling fronted on the street,\nThe latest house to landward; but behind,\nWith one small gate that open'd on the waste,\nFlourish'd a little garden square and wall'd:\nAnd in it throve an ancient evergreen,\nA yewtree, and all round it ran a walk\nOf shingle, and a walk divided it:\nBut Enoch shunn'd the middle walk and stole\nUp by the wall, behind the yew; and thence\nThat which he better might have shunn'd, if griefs\nLike his have worse or better, Enoch saw.\n\nFor cups and silver on the burnish'd board\nSparkled and shone; so genial was the hearth:\nAnd on the right hand of the hearth he saw\nPhilip, the slighted suitor of old times,\nStout, rosy, with his babe across his knees;\nAnd o'er her second father stoopt a girl,\nA later but a loftier Annie Lee,\nFair-hair'd and tall, and from her lifted hand\nDangled a length of ribbon and a ring\nTo tempt the babe, who rear'd his creasy arms,\nCaught at and ever miss'd it, and they laugh'd:\nAnd on the left hand of the hearth he saw\nThe mother glancing often toward her babe,\nBut turning now and then to speak with him,\nHer son, who stood beside her tall and strong,\nAnd saying that which pleased him, for he smiled.\n\nNow when the dead man come to life beheld\nHis wife his wife no more, and saw the babe\nHers, yet not his, upon the father's knee,\nAnd all the warmth, the peace, the happiness,\nAnd his own children tall and beautiful,\nAnd him, that other, reigning in his place,\nLord of his rights and of his children's love,--\nThen he, tho' Miriam Lane had told him all,\nBecause things seen are mightier than things heard,\nStagger'd and shook, holding the branch, and fear'd\nTo send abroad a shrill and terrible cry,\nWhich in one moment, like the blast of doom,\nWould shatter all the happiness of the hearth.\n\nHe therefore turning softly like a thief,\nLest the harsh shingle should grate underfoot,\nAnd feeling all along the garden-wall,\nLest he should swoon and tumble and be found,\nCrept to the gate, and open'd it, and closed,\nAs lightly as a sick man's chamber-door,\nBehind him, and came out upon the waste.\n\nAnd there he would have knelt, but that his knees\nWere feeble, so that falling prone he dug\nHis fingers into the wet earth, and pray'd.\n\n`Too hard to bear! why did they take me hence?\nO God Almighty, blessed Saviour, Thou\nThat didst uphold me on my lonely isle,\nUphold me, Father, in my loneliness\nA little longer! aid me, give me strength\nNot to tell her, never to let her know.\nHelp me no to break in upon her peace.\nMy children too! must I not speak to these?\nThey know me not. I should betray myself.\nNever: not father's kiss for me--the girl\nSo like her mother, and the boy, my son.'\n\nThere speech and thought and nature fail'd a little,\nAnd he lay tranced; but when he rose and paced\nBack toward his solitary home again,\nAll down the long and narrow street he went\nBeating it in upon his weary brain,\nAs tho' it were the burthen of a song,\n`Not to tell her, never to let her know.'\n\nHe was not all unhappy. His resolve\nUpbore him, and firm faith, and evermore\nPrayer from a living source within the will,\nAnd beating up thro' all the bitter world,\nLike fountains of sweet water in the sea,\nKept him a living soul. `This miller's wife'\nHe said to Miriam `that you told me of,\nHas she no fear that her first husband lives?'\n`Ay ay, poor soul' said Miriam, `fear enow!\nIf you could tell her you had seen him dead,\nWhy, that would be her comfort;' and he thought\n`After the Lord has call'd me she shall know,\nI wait His time' and Enoch set himself,\nScorning an alms, to work whereby to live.\nAlmost to all things could he turn his hand.\nCooper he was and carpenter, and wrought\nTo make the boatmen fishing-nets, or help'd\nAt lading and unlading the tall barks,\nThat brought the stinted commerce of those days;\nThus earn'd a scanty living for himself:\nYet since he did but labor for himself,\nWork without hope, there was not life in it\nWhereby the man could live; and as the year\nRoll'd itself round again to meet the day\nWhen Enoch had return'd, a languor came\nUpon him, gentle sickness, gradually\nWeakening the man, till he could do no more,\nBut kept the house, his chair, and last his bed.\nAnd Enoch bore his weakness cheerfully.\nFor sure no gladlier does the stranded wreck\nSee thro' the gray skirts of a lifting squall\nThe boat that bears the hope of life approach\nTo save the life despair'd of, than he saw\nDeath dawning on him, and the close of all.\n\nFor thro' that dawning gleam'd a kindlier hope\nOn Enoch thinking `after I am gone,\nThen may she learn I loved her to the last.'\nHe call'd aloud for Miriam Lane and said\n`Woman, I have a secret--only swear,\nBefore I tell you--swear upon the book\nNot to reveal it, till you see me dead.'\n`Dead' clamor'd the good woman `hear him talk!\nI warrant, man, that we shall bring you round.'\n`Swear' add Enoch sternly `on the book.'\nAnd on the book, half-frighted, Miriam swore.\nThen Enoch rolling his gray eyes upon her,\n`Did you know Enoch Arden of this town?'\n`Know him?' she said `I knew him far away.\nAy, ay, I mind him coming down the street;\nHeld his head high, and cared for no man, he.'\nSlowly and sadly Enoch answer'd her;\n`His head is low, and no man cares for him.\nI think I have not three days more to live;\nI am the man.' At which the woman gave\nA half-incredulous, half-hysterical cry.\n`You Arden, you! nay,--sure he was a foot\nHigher than you be.' Enoch said again\n`My God has bow'd me down to what I am;\nMy grief and solitude have broken me;\nNevertheless, know that I am he\nWho married--but that name has twice been changed--\nI married her who married Philip Ray.\nSit, listen.' Then he told her of his voyage,\nHis wreck, his lonely life, his coming back,\nHis gazing in on Annie, his resolve,\nAnd how he kept it. As the woman heard,\nFast flow'd the current of her easy tears,\nWhile in her heart she yearn'd incessantly\nTo rush abroad all round the little haven,\nProclaiming Enoch Arden and his woes;\nBut awed and promise-bounded she forbore,\nSaying only `See your bairns before you go!\nEh, let me fetch 'em, Arden,' and arose\nEager to bring them down, for Enoch hung\nA moment on her words, but then replied.\n\n`Woman, disturb me not now at the last,\nBut let me hold my purpose till I die.\nSit down again; mark me and understand,\nWhile I have power to speak. I charge you now,\nWhen you shall see her, tell her that I died\nBlessing her, praying for her, loving her;\nSave for the bar between us, loving her\nAs when she laid her head beside my own.\nAnd tell my daughter Annie, whom I saw\nSo like her mother, that my latest breath\nWas spent in blessing her and praying for her.\nAnd tell my son that I died blessing him.\nAnd say to Philip that I blest him too;\nHe never meant us any thing but good.\nBut if my children care to see me dead,\nWho hardly saw me living, let them come,\nI am their father; but she must not come,\nFor my dead face would vex her after-life.\nAnd now there is but one of all my blood,\nWho will embrace me in the world-to-be:\nThis hair is his: she cut it off and gave it,\nAnd I have borne it with me all these years,\nAnd thought to bear it with me to my grave;\nBut now my mind is changed, for I shall see him,\nMy babe in bliss: wherefore when I am gone,\nTake, give her this, for it may comfort her:\nIt will moreover be a token to her,\nThat I am he.'\n\nHe ceased; and Miriam Lane\nMade such a voluble answer promising all,\nThat once again he roll'd his eyes upon her\nRepeating all he wish'd, and once again\nShe promised.\n\nThen the third night after this,\nWhile Enoch slumber'd motionless and pale,\nAnd Miriam watch'd and dozed at intervals,\nThere came so loud a calling of the sea,\nThat all the houses in the haven rang.\nHe woke, he rose, he spread his arms abroad\nCrying with a loud voice `a sail! a sail!\nI am saved'; and so fell back and spoke no more.\n\nSo past the strong heroic soul away.\nAnd when they buried him the little port\nHad seldom seen a costlier funeral.","title":"Enoch Arden"},{"lines":"What does little birdie say\nIn her nest at peep of day?\nLet me fly, says little birdie,\nMother, let me fly away.\nBirdie, rest a little longer,\nTill thy little wings are stronger.\nSo she rests a little longer,\nThen she flies away.\n\nWhat does little baby say,\nIn her bed at peep of day?\nBaby says, like little birdie,\nLet me rise and fly away.\nBaby, sleep a little longer,\nTill thy little limbs are stronger.\nIf she sleeps a little longer,\nBaby too shall fly away.","title":"Cradle Song"},{"lines":"Once in a golden hour\nI cast to earth a seed.\nUp there came a flower,\nThe people said, a weed.\n\nTo and fro they went\nThro' my garden bower,\nAnd muttering discontent\nCursed me and my flower.\n\nThen it grew so tall\nIt wore a crown of light,\nBut thieves from o'er the wall\nStole the seed by night.\n\nSow'd it far and wide\nBy every town and tower,\nTill all the people cried,\n\"Splendid is the flower!\"\n\nRead my little fable:\nHe that runs may read.\nMost can raise the flowers now,\nFor all have got the seed.\n\nAnd some are pretty enough,\nAnd some are poor indeed;\nAnd now again the people\nCall it but a weed.","title":"The Flower"}],"Louisa May Alcott":[{"lines":"From our happy home\nThrough the world we roam\nOne week in all the year,\nMaking winter spring\nWith the joy we bring\nFor Christmas-tide is here.\n\nNow the eastern star\nShines from afar\nTo light the poorest home;\nHearts warmer grow,\nGifts freely flow,\nFor Christmas-tide has come.\n\nNow gay trees rise\nBefore young eyes,\nAbloom with tempting cheer;\nBlithe voices sing,\nAnd blithe bells ring,\nFor Christmas-tide is here.\n\nOh, happy chime,\nOh, blessed time,\nThat draws us all so near!\n\"Welcome, dear day,\"\nAll creatures say,\nFor Christmas-tide is here.","title":"From The Short Story A Christmas Dream, And How It Came True"},{"lines":"O lesson well and wisely taught\nStay with me to the last,\nThat all my life may better be\nFor the trial that is past.\nO vanity, mislead no more!\nSleep, like passions, long!\nWake, happy heart, and dance again\nTo the music of my song!\n\nO summer days, flit fast away,\nAnd bring the blithesome hour\nWhen we three wanderers shall meet\nSafe in our household flower!\nO dear mamma, lament no more!\nSmile on us as we come,\nYour grief has been our punishment,\nYour love has led us home.","title":"The Rose Family - Song II"},{"lines":"O flower at my window\nWhy blossom you so fair,\nWith your green and purple cup\nUpturned to sun and air?\n'I bloom, blithesome Bessie,\nTo cheer your childish heart;\nThe world is full of labor,\nAnd this shall be my part.'\nWhirl, busy wheel, faster,\nSpin, little thread, spin;\nThe sun shines fair without,\nAnd we are gay within.\n\nO robin in the tree-top,\nWith sunshine on your breast,\nWhy brood you so patiently\nAbove your hidden nest?\n'I brood, blithesome Bessie,\nAnd sing my humble song,\nThat the world may have more music\nFrom my little ones erelong.'\nWhirl, busy wheel, faster,\nSpin, little thread, spin;\nThe sun shines fair without,\nAnd we are gay within.\n\nO balmy wind of summer,\nO silver-singing brook,\nWhy rustle through the branches?\nWhy shimmer in your nook?\n'I flutter, blithesome Bessie,\nLike a blessing far and wide;\nI scatter bloom and verdue\nWhere'er my footsteps glide.'\nWhirl, busy wheel, faster,\nSpin, little thread, spin;\nThe sun shines fair without,\nAnd we are gay within.\n\nO brook and breeze and blossom,\nAnd robin on the tree,\nYou make a joy of duty,\nA pride of industry;\nTeach me to work as blithely,\nWith a willing hand and heart:\nThe world is full of labor,\nAnd I must do my part.\nWhirl, busy wheel, faster,\nSpin, little thread, spin;\nThe sun shines fair without,\nAnd we are gay within.","title":"The Rose Family - Song 1"},{"lines":"Little shadows, little shadows\nDancing on the chamber wall,\nWhile I sit beside the hearthstone\nWhere the red flames rise and fall.\nCaps and nightgowns, caps and nightgowns,\nMy three antic shadows wear;\nAnd no sound they make in playing,\nFor the six small feet are bare.\n\nDancing gayly, dancing gayly,\nTo and fro all together,\nLike a family of daisies\nBlown about in windy weather;\nNimble fairies, nimble fairies,\nPlaying pranks in the warm glow,\nWhile I sing the nursery ditties\nChildish phantoms love and know.\n\nNow what happens, now what happens?\nOne small shadow's tumbled down:\nI can see it on the carpet\nSoftly rubbing its hurt crown.\nNo one whimpers, no one whimpers;\nA brave-hearted sprite is this:\nSee!

Gudurz and Zoarrah came\nAnd Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host\nSecond, and was the uncle of the King\nThese came and counsell'd, and then Gudurz said:--\n\n\"Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up,\nYet champion have we none to match this youth.\nHe has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart.\nBut Rustum came last night; aloof he sits\nAnd sullen, and has pitch'd his tents apart.\nHim will I seek, and carry to his ear\nThe Tartar challenge, and this young man's name.\nHaply he will forget his wrath, and fight.\nStand forth the while, and take their challenge up.\"\n\nSo spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried.--\n\"Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said!\nLet Sohrab arm, and we will find a man.\"\n\nHe spake: and Peran-Wisa turn'd, and strode\nBack through the opening squadrons to his tent.\nBut through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran,\nAnd cross'd the camp which lay behind, and reach'd,\nOut on the sands beyond it, Rustum's tents.\nOf scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay\nJust pitch'd;

and all eyes turn to thee.\nCome down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!''\n\nHe spoke; but Rustum answer'd with a smile:--\n\"Go to! if Iran's chiefs are old, then I\nAm older; if the young are weak, the King\nErrs strangely; for the King, for Kai Khosroo,\nHimself is young, and honours younger men,\nAnd lets the aged moulder to their graves.\nRustum he loves no more, but loves the young--\nThe young may rise at Sohrab's vaunts, not I.\nFor what care I, though all speak Sohrab's fame?\nFor would that I myself had such a son,\nAnd not that one slight helpless girl I have--\nA son so famed, so brave, to send to war,\nAnd I to tarry with the snow-hair'd Zal,\nMy father, whom the robber Afghans vex,\nAnd clip his borders short, and drive his herds,\nAnd he has none to guard his weak old age.\nThere would I go, and hang my armour up,\nAnd with my great name fence that weak old man,\nAnd spend the goodly treasures I have got,\nAnd rest my age, and hear of Sohrab's fame,\nAnd leave to death the hosts of thankless kings,\nAnd with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more.''\n\nHe spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply:---\n\"What then, O Rustum, will men say to this,\nWhen Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks\nThee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks,\nHidest thy face? Take heed lest men should say:\nLike some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame,\nAnd shuns to peril it with younger men.\"\n\nAnd, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply:--\n\"O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words?\nThou knowest better words than this to say.\nWhat is one more, one less, obscure or famed,\nValiant or craven, young or old, to me?\nAre not they mortal, am not I myself?\nBut who for men of nought would do great deeds?\nCome, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame!\nBut I will fight unknown, and in plain arms;\nLet not men say of Rustum, he was match'd\nIn single fight with any mortal man.\"\n\nHe spoke, and frown'd; and Gudurz turn'd, and ran\nBack quickly through the camp in fear and joy--\nFear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came.\nBut Rustum strode to his tent-door, and call'd\nHis followers in, and bade them bring his arms,\nAnd clad himself in steel; the arms he chose\nWere plain, and on his shield was no device,\nOnly his helm was rich, inlaid with gold,\nAnd, from the fluted spine atop, a plume\nOf horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume.\nSo arm'd, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse,\nFollow'd him like a faithful hound at heel--\nRuksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth,\nThe horse, whom Rustum on a foray once\nDid in Bokhara by the river find\nA colt beneath its dam, and drove him home,\nAnd rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty crest,\nDight with a saddle-cloth of broider'd green\nCrusted with gold, and on the ground were work'd\nAll beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know.\nSo follow'd, Rustum left his tents, and cross'd\nThe camp, and to the Persian host appear'd.\nAnd all the Persians knew him, and with shouts\nHail'd; but the Tartars knew not who he was.\nAnd dear as the wet diver to the eyes\nOf his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore,\nBy sandy Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf,\nPlunging all day in the blue waves, at night,\nHaving made up his tale of precious pearls,\nRejoins her in their hut upon the sands--\nSo dear to the pale Persians Rustum came.\n\nAnd Rustum to the Persian front advanced,\nAnd Sohrab arm'd in Haman's tent, and came.\nAnd as afield the reapers cut a swath\nDown through the middle of a rich man's corn,\nAnd on each side are squares of standing corn,\nAnd in the midst a stubble, short and bare--\nSo on each side were squares of men, with spears\nBristling, and in the midst, the open sand.\nAnd Rustum came upon the sand, and cast\nHis eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw\nSohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came.\n\nAs some rich woman, on a winter's morn,\nEyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge\nWho with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire--\nAt cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn,\nWhen the frost flowers the whiten'd window-panes--\nAnd wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts\nOf that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed\nThe unknown adventurous youth, who from afar\nCame seeking Rustum, and defying forth\nAll the most valiant chiefs; long he perused\nHis spirited air, and wonder'd who he was.\nFor very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd;\nLike some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight,\nWhich in a queen's secluded garden throws\nIts slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,\nBy midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound--\nSo slender Sohrab seem'd, so softly rear'd.\nAnd a deep pity enter'd Rustum's soul\nAs he beheld him coming; and he stood,\nAnd beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:--\n\n\"O thou young man, the air of Heaven is soft,\nAnd warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold!\nHeaven's air is better than the cold dead grave.\nBehold me! I am vast, and clad in iron,\nAnd tried; and I have stood on many a field\nOf blood, and I have fought with many a foe--\nNever was that field lost, or that foe saved.\nO Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?\nBe govern'd! quit the Tartar host, and come\nTo Iran, and be as my son to me,\nAnd fight beneath my banner till I die!\nThere are no youths in Iran brave as thou.\"\n\nSo he spake, mildly; Sohrab heard his voice,\nThe mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw\nHis giant figure planted on the sand,\nSole, like some single tower, which a chief\nHath builded on the waste in former years\nAgainst the robbers; and he saw that head,\nStreak'd with its first grey hairs;--hope filled his soul,\nAnd he ran forward and embraced his knees\nAnd clasp'd his hand within his own, and said:--\n\n\"O, by thy father's head! by thine own soul!\nArt thou not Rustum? speak! art thou not he?\"\n\nBut Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,\nAnd turn'd away, and spake to his own soul:--\n\n\"Ah me, I muse what this young fox may mean!\nFalse, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys.\nFor if I now confess this thing he asks,\nAnd hide it not, but say: Rustum is here!\nHe will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes,\nBut he will find some pretext not to fight,\nAnd praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts,\nA belt or sword perhaps, and go his way.\nAnd on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab's hall,\nIn Samarcand, he will arise and cry:\n`I challenged once, when the two armies camp'd\nBeside the Oxus, all the Persian lords\nTo cope with me in single fight; but they\nShrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I\nChanged gifts, and went on equal terms away.'\nSo will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud;\nThen were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me.\"\n\nAnd then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:--\n'Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus\nOf Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast call'd\nBy challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield!\nIs it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight?\nRash boy, men look on Rustum's face and flee\nFor well I know, that did great Rustum stand\nBefore thy face this day, and were reveal'd,\nThere would be then no talk of fighting more.\nBut being what I am, I tell thee this--\nDo thou record it in thine inmost soul:\nEither thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield,\nOr else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds\nBleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods,\nOxus in summer wash them all away.\"\n\nHe spoke; and Sohrab answer'd, on his feet:--\n\"Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fright me so!\nI am no girl, to be made pale by words.\nYet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand\nHere on this field, there were no fighting then.\nBut Rustum is far hence, and we stand here.\nBegin! thou art more vast, more dread than I,\nAnd thou art proved, I know, and I am young--\nBut yet success sways with the breath of Heaven.\nAnd though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure\nThy victory, yet thou canst not surely know.\nFor we are all, like swimmers in the sea,\nPoised on the top of a huge wave of fate,\nWhich hangs uncertain to which side to fall.\nAnd whether it will heave us up to land,\nOr whether it will roll us out to sea,\nBack out to sea, to the deep waves of death,\nWe know not, and no search will make us know;\nOnly the event will teach us in its hour.\"\n\nHe spoke, and Rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd\nHis spear; down from the shoulder, down it came,\nAs on some partridge in the corn a hawk,\nThat long has tower'd in the airy clouds,\nDrops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come,\nAnd sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear\nHiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand,\nWhich it sent flying wide;--then Sohrab threw\nIn turn, and full struck Rustum's shield; sharp rang,\nThe iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear.\nAnd Rustum seized his club, which none but he\nCould wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge,\nStill rough--like those which men in treeless plains\nTo build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,\nHyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high up\nBy their dark springs, the wind in winter-time\nHath made in Himalayan forests wrack,\nAnd strewn the channels with torn boughs--so huge\nThe club which Rustum lifted now, and struck\nOne stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,\nLithe as the glancing snake, and the club came\nThundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum's hand.\nAnd Rustum follow'd his own blow, and fell\nTo his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand;\nAnd now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,\nAnd pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay\nDizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;\nBut he look'd on, and smiled, nor bared his sword,\nBut courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:--\n\n\"Thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will float\nUpon the summer-floods, and not my bones.\nBut rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I;\nNo, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul.\nThou say'st, thou art not Rustum; be it so!\nWho art thou then, that canst so touch my soul?\nBoy as I am, I have seen battles too--\nHave waded foremost in their bloody waves,\nAnd heard their hollow roar of dying men;\nBut never was my heart thus touch'd before.\nAre they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart?\nO thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven!\nCome, plant we here in earth our angry spears,\nAnd make a truce, and sit upon this sand,\nAnd pledge each other in red wine, like friends,\nAnd thou shalt talk to me of Rustum's deeds.\nThere are enough foes in the Persian host,\nWhom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;\nChampions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou\nMayst fight; fight them, when they confront thy spear!\nBut oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!\"\n\nHe ceased, but while he spake, Rustum had risen,\nAnd stood erect, trembling with rage; his club\nHe left to lie, but had regain'd his spear,\nWhose fiery point now in his mail'd right-hand\nBlazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star,\nThe baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil'd\nHis stately crest, and dimm'd his glittering arms.\nHis breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his voice\nWas choked with rage; at last these words broke way.--\n\n\"Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands!\nCurl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words!\nFight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more!\nThou art not in Afrasiab's gardens now\nWith Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;\nBut on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance\nOf battle, and with me, who make no play\nOf war; I fight it out, and hand to hand.\nSpeak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine!\nRemember all thy valour; try thy feints\nAnd cunning! all the pity I had is gone;\nBecause thou hast shamed me before both the hosts\nWith thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles.\"\n\nHe spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his taunts,\nAnd he too drew his sword; at once they rush'd\nTogether, as two eagles on one prey\nCome rushing down together from the clouds,\nOne from the east, one from the west; their shields\nDash'd with a clang together, and a din\nRose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters\nMake often in the forest's heart at morn,\nOf hewing axes, crashing trees--such blows\nRustum and Sohrab on each other hail'd.\nAnd you would say that sun and stars took part\nIn that unnatural conflict; for a cloud\nGrew suddenly in Heaven, and dark'd the sun\nOver the fighters' heads; and a wind rose\nUnder their feet, and moaning swept the plain,\nAnd in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair.\nIn gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone;\nFor both the on-looking hosts on either hand\nStood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,\nAnd the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.\nBut in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes\nAnd labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield\nWhich Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear\nRent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the skin,\nAnd Rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan.\nThen Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm,\nNor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest\nHe shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,\nNever till now defiled, sank to the dust;\nAnd Rustum bow'd his head; but then the gloom\nGrew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,\nAnd lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,\nWho stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry;--\nNo horse's cry was that, most like the roar\nOf some pain'd desert-lion, who all day\nHath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his side,\nAnd comes at night to die upon the sand.\nThe two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,\nAnd Oxus curdled as it cross'd his stream.\nBut Sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on,\nAnd struck again; and again Rustum bow'd\nHis head; but this time all the blade, like glass,\nSprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,\nAnd in the hand the hilt remain'd alone.\nThen Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes\nGlared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,\nAnd shouted: Rustum!--Sohrab heard that shout,\nAnd shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one step,\nAnd scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form,\nAnd then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd\nHis covering shield, and the spear pierced his side.\nHe reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the ground;\nAnd then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,\nAnd the bright sun broke forth, and melted all\nThe cloud; and the two armies saw the pair--\nSaw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,\nAnd Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand.\n\nThen, with a bitter smile, Rustum began:--\n\"Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill\nA Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse\nAnd bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent.\nOr else that the great Rustum would come down\nHimself to fight, and that thy wiles would move\nHis heart to take a gift, and let thee go.\nAnd then that all the Tartar host would praise\nThy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,\nTo glad thy father in his weak old age.\nFool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!\nDearer to the red jackals shalt thou be\nThan to thy friends, and to thy father old.\"\n\nAnd, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:--\n\"Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain.\nThou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!\nNo! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart.\nFor were I match'd with ten such men as thee,\nAnd I were that which till to-day I was,\nThey should be lying here, I standing there.\nBut that belovиd name unnerved my arm--\nThat name, and something, I confess, in thee,\nWhich troubles all my heart, and made my shield\nFall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe.\nAnd now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate.\nBut hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear:\nThe mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!\nMy father, whom I seek through all the world,\nHe shall avenge my death, and punish thee!\"\n\nAs when some hunter in the spring hath found\nA breeding eagle sitting on her nest,\nUpon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,\nAnd pierced her with an arrow as she rose,\nAnd follow'd her to find her where she fell\nFar off;--anon her mate comes winging back\nFrom hunting, and a great way off descries\nHis huddling young left sole; at that, he checks\nHis pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps\nCircles above his eyry, with loud screams\nChiding his mate back to her nest; but she\nLies dying, with the arrow in her side,\nIn some far stony gorge out of his ken,\nA heap of fluttering feathers--never more\nShall the lake glass her, flying over it;\nNever the black and dripping precipices\nEcho her stormy scream as she sails by--\nAs that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,\nSo Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood\nOver his dying son, and knew him not.\n\nBut, with a cold, incredulous voice, he said:--\n\"What prate is this of fathers and revenge?\nThe mighty Rustum never had a son.\"\n\nAnd, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:--\n\"Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I.\nSurely the news will one day reach his ear,\nReach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,\nSomewhere, I know not where, but far from here;\nAnd pierce him like a stab, and make him leap\nTo arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee.\nFierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!\nWhat will that grief, what will that vengeance be?\nOh, could I live, till I that grief had seen!\nYet him I pity not so much, but her,\nMy mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells\nWith that old king, her father, who grows grey\nWith age, and rules over the valiant Koords.\nHer most I pity, who no more will see\nSohrab returning from the Tartar camp,\nWith spoils and honour, when the war is done.\nBut a dark rumour will be bruited up,\nFrom tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;\nAnd then will that defenceless woman learn\nThat Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,\nBut that in battle with a nameless foe,\nBy the far-distant Oxus, he is slain.\"\n\nHe spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud,\nThinking of her he left, and his own death.\nHe spoke; but Rustum listen'd, plunged in thought.\nNor did he yet believe it was his son\nWho spoke, although he call'd back names he knew;\nFor he had had sure tidings that the babe,\nWhich was in Ader-baijan born to him,\nHad been a puny girl, no boy at all--\nSo that sad mother sent him word, for fear\nRustum should seek the boy, to train in arms.\nAnd so he deem'd that either Sohrab took,\nBy a false boast, the style of Rustum's son;\nOr that men gave it him, to swell his fame.\nSo deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in thought\nAnd his soul set to grief, as the vast tide\nOf the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore\nAt the full moon; tears gather'd in his eyes;\nFor he remember'd his own early youth,\nAnd all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,\nThe shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries\nA far, bright city, smitten by the sun,\nThrough many rolling clouds---so Rustum saw\nHis youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;\nAnd that old king, her father, who loved well\nHis wandering guest, and gave him his fair child\nWith joy; and all the pleasant life they led,\nThey three, in that long-distant summer-time--\nThe castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt\nAnd hound, and morn on those delightful hills\nIn Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth,\nOf age and looks to be his own dear son,\nPiteous and lovely, lying on the sand,\nLike some rich hyacinth which by the scythe\nOf an unskilful gardener has been cut,\nMowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,\nAnd lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,\nOn the mown, dying grass--so Sohrab lay,\nLovely in death, upon the common sand.\nAnd Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:--\n\n\"O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son\nWhom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved!\nYet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men\nHave told thee false--thou art not Rustum's son.\nFor Rustum had no son; one child he had--\nBut one--a girl; who with her mother now\nPlies some light female task, nor dreams of us--\nOf us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war.\"\n\nBut Sohrab answer'd him in wrath: for now\nThe anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce,\nAnd he desired to draw forth the steel,\nAnd let the blood flow free, and so to die--\nBut first he would convince his stubborn foe;\nAnd, rising sternly on one arm, he said:--\n\n\"Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?\nTruth sits upon the lips of dying men,\nAnd falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine.\nI tell thee, prick'd upon this arm I bear\nThat seal which Rustum to my mother gave,\nThat she might prick it on the babe she bore.\"\n\nHe spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks,\nAnd his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand\nAgainst his breast, his heavy mailed hand,\nThat the hard iron corslet clank'd aloud;\nAnd to his heart he press'd the other hand,\nAnd in a hollow voice he spake, and said:--\n\nSohrab, that were a proof which could not lie!\nIf thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son.\"\n\nThen, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed\nHis belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,\nAnd show'd a sign in faint vermilion points\nPrick'd; as a cunning workman, in Pekin,\nPricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,\nAn emperor's gift--at early morn he paints,\nAnd all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp\nLights up his studious forehead and thin hands--\nSo delicately prick'd the sign appear'd\nOn Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal.\nIt was that griffin, which of old rear'd Zal,\nRustum's great father, whom they left to die,\nA helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks;\nHim that kind creature found, and rear'd, and loved--\nThen Rustum took it for his glorious sign.\nAnd Sohrab bared that image on his arm,\nAnd himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes,\nAnd then he touch'd it with his hand and said:--\n\n\"How say'st thou? Is that sign the proper sign\nOf Rustum's son, or of some other man's?\"\n\nHe spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood\nSpeechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry:\nO boy--thy father!--and his voice choked there.\nAnd then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes,\nAnd his head swam, and he sank down to earth.\nBut Sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast\nHis arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips,\nAnd with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,\nTrying to call him back to life; and life\nCame back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,\nAnd they stood wide with horror; and he seized\nIn both his hands the dust which lay around,\nAnd threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,--\nHis hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;\nAnd strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,\nAnd his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his sword,\nTo draw it, and for ever let life out.\nBut Sohrab saw his thoughts, and held his hands\nAnd with a soothing voice he spake, and said:--\n\n\"Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day\nThe doom which at my birth was written down\nIn Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand.\nSurely my heart cried out that it was thou,\nWhen first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,\nI know it! but fate trod those promptings down\nUnder its iron heel; fate, fate engaged\nThe strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear.\nBut let us speak no more of this! I find\nMy father; let me feel that I have found!\nCome, sit beside me on this sand, and take\nMy head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,\nAnd wash them with thy tears, and say: My son!\nQuick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life\nAnd swift; for like the lightning to this field\nI came, and like the wind I go away--\nSudden, and swift, and like a passing wind.\nBut it was writ in Heaven that this should be.\"\n\nSo said he, and his voice released the heart\nOf Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast\nHis arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,\nAnd kiss'd him. And awe fell on both the hosts,\nWhen they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the horse,\nWith his head bowing to the ground and mane\nSweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe\nFirst to the one then to the other moved\nHis head, as if enquiring what their grief\nMight mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,\nThe big warm tears roll'd down, and caked the sand.\nBut Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:--\n\n\"Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet\nShould first have rotted on their nimble joints,\nOr ere they brought thy master to this field!\"\n\nBut Sohrab look'd upon the horse and said;--\n\"Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past days\nMy mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,\nMy terrible father's terrible horse! and said,\nThat I should one day find thy lord and thee.\nCome, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!\nO Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;\nFor thou has gone where I shall never go,\nAnd snuff'd the breezes of my father's home.\nAnd thou hast trod the sands of Seistan\nAnd seen the River of Helmund, and the Lake\nOf Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself\nHas often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,\nCorn in a golden platter soak'd with wine,\nAnd said; O Ruksh! bear Rustrum well!--but I\nHave never known my grandsire's furrow'd face,\nNor seen his lofty house in Seistan,\nNor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;\nBut lodged among my father's foes, and seen\nAfrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,\nBokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,\nAnd the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk\nThe desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,\nKohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,\nThe northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream,\nThe yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die.\"\n\nThen, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewail'd:--\n\"Oh, that its waves were flowing over me!\nOh, that I saw its grains of yellow silt\nRoll, tumbling in the current o'er my head!\"\n\nBut, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:--\n\"Desire not that, my father! thou must live.\nFor some are born to do great deeds, and live,\nAs some are born to be obscured, and die.\nDo thou the deeds I die too young to do,\nAnd reap a second glory in thine age;\nThou art my father, and thy gain is mine.\nBut come!

please,\nHow often have I loitered o'er your green,\nWhere humble happiness endeared each scene;\nHow often have I paused on every charm,\nThe sheltered cot, the cultivated farm,\nThe never-failing brook, the busy mill,\nThe decent church that topped the neighbouring hill,\nThe hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,\nFor talking age and whispering lovers made;\nHow often have I blessed the coming day,\nWhen toil remitting lent its turn to play,\nAnd all the village train, from labour free,\nLed up their sports beneath the spreading tree:\nWhile many a pastime circled in the shade,\nThe young contending as the old surveyed;\nAnd many a gambol frolicked o'er the ground,\nAnd sleights of art and feats of strength went round;\nAnd still as each repeated pleasure tired,\nSucceeding sports the mirthful band inspired;\nThe dancing pair that simply sought renown\nBy holding out to tire each other down!\nThe swain mistrustless of his smutted face,\nWhile secret laughter tittered round the place;\nThe bashful virgin's sidelong look of love,\nThe matron's glance that would those looks reprove:\nThese were thy charms, sweet village; sports like these,\nWith sweet succession, taught even toil to please;\nThese round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed,\nThese were thy charms—But all these charms are fled.\n\nSweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,\nThy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn;\nAmidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen,\nAnd desolation saddens all thy green:\nOne only master grasps the whole domain,\nAnd half a tillage stints thy smiling plain:\nNo more thy glassy brook reflects the day,\nBut choked with sedges works its weedy way.\nAlong thy glades, a solitary guest,\nThe hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest;\nAmidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies,\nAnd tires their echoes with unvaried cries.\nSunk are thy bowers, in shapeless ruin all,\nAnd the long grass o'ertops the mouldering wall;\nAnd, trembling, shrinking from the spoiler's hand,\nFar, far away, thy children leave the land.\n\nIll fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,\nWhere wealth accumulates, and men decay:\nPrinces and lords may flourish, or may fade;\nA breath can make them, as a breath has made;\nBut a bold peasantry, their country's pride,\nWhen once destroyed can never be supplied.\n\nA time there was, ere England's griefs began,\nWhen every rood of ground maintained its man;\nFor him light labour spread her wholesome store,\nJust gave what life required, but gave no more:\nHis best companions, innocence and health;\nAnd his best riches, ignorance of wealth.\n\nBut times are altered; trade's unfeeling train\nUsurp the land and dispossess the swain;\nAlong the lawn, where scattered hamlet's rose,\nUnwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose,\nAnd every want to opulence allied,\nAnd every pang that folly pays to pride.\nThose gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,\nThose calm desires that asked but little room,\nThose healthful sports that graced the peaceful scene,\nLived in each look, and brightened all the green;\nThese, far departing, seek a kinder shore,\nAnd rural mirth and manners are no more.\n\nSweet Auburn! parent of the blissful hour,\nThy glades forlorn confess the tyrant's power.\nHere as I take my solitary rounds,\nAmidst thy tangling walks and ruined grounds,\nAnd, many a year elapsed, return to view\nWhere once the cottage stood, the hawthorn grew,\nRemembrance wakes with all her busy train,\nSwells at my breast, and turns the past to pain.\n\nIn all my wanderings round this world of care,\nIn all my griefs—and God has given my share—\nI still had hopes my latest hours to crown,\nAmidst these humble bowers to lay me down;\nTo husband out life's taper at the close,\nAnd keep the flame from wasting by repose.\nI still had hopes, for pride attends us still,\nAmidst the swains to show my book-learned skill,\nAround my fire an evening group to draw,\nAnd tell of all I felt and all I saw;\nAnd, as a hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,\nPants to the place from whence at first she flew,\nI still had hopes, my long vexations passed,\nHere to return—and die at home at last.\n\nO blest retirement, friend to life's decline,\nRetreats from care, that never must be mine,\nHow happy he who crowns in shades like these\nA youth of labour with an age of ease;\nWho quits a world where strong temptations try,\nAnd, since 'tis hard to combat, learns to fly!\nFor him no wretches, born to work and weep,\nExplore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep;\nNo surly porter stands in guilty state\nTo spurn imploring famine from the gate;\nBut on he moves to meet his latter end,\nAngels round befriending Virtue's friend;\nBends to the grave with unperceived decay,\nWhile Resignation gently slopes the way;\nAll, all his prospects brightening to the last,\nHis Heaven commences ere the world be past!\n\nSweet was the sound when oft at evening's close\nUp yonder hill the village murmur rose;\nThere, as I passed with careless steps and slow,\nThe mingling notes came softened from below;\nThe swain responsive as the milkmaid sung,\nThe sober herd that lowed to meet their young;\nThe noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool,\nThe playful children just let loose from school;\nThe watchdog's voice that bayed the whisp'ring wind,\nAnd the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind;\nThese all in sweet confusion sought the shade,\nAnd filled each pause the nightingale had made.\nBut now the sounds of population fail,\nNo cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale,\nNo busy steps the grass-grown footway tread,\nFor all the bloomy flush of life is fled.\nAll but yon widowed, solitary thing,\nThat feebly bends beside the plashy spring;\nShe, wretched matron, forced in age for bread\nTo strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,\nTo pick her wintry faggot from the thorn,\nTo seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn;\nShe only left of all the harmless train,\nThe sad historian of the pensive plain.\n\nNear yonder copse, where once the garden smiled,\nAnd still where many a garden flower grows wild;\nThere, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,\nThe village preacher's modest mansion rose.\nA man he was to all the country dear,\nAnd passing rich with forty pounds a year;\nRemote from towns he ran his godly race,\nNor e'er had changed, nor wished to change, his place;\nUnpractised he to fawn, or seek for power,\nBy doctrines fashioned to the varying hour;\nFar other aims his heart had learned to prize,\nMore skilled to raise the wretched than to rise.\nHis house was known to all the vagrant train,\nHe chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain;\nThe long remembered beggar was his guest,\nWhose beard descending swept his aged breast;\nThe ruined spendthrift, now no longer proud,\nClaimed kindred there, and had his claims allowed;\nThe broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,\nSat by his fire, and talked the night away;\nWept o'er his wounds, or, tales of sorrow done,\nShouldered his crutch, and showed how fields were won.\nPleased with his guests, the good man learned to glow,\nAnd quite forgot their vices in their woe;\nCareless their merits or their faults to scan,\nHis pity gave ere charity began.\n\nThus to relieve the wretched was his pride,\nAnd e'en his failings leaned to Virtue's side;\nBut in his duty prompt at every call,\nHe watched and wept, he prayed and felt, for all.\nAnd, as a bird each fond endearment tries\nTo tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,\nHe tried each art, reproved each dull delay,\nAllured to brighter worlds, and led the way.\n\nBeside the bed where parting life was laid,\nAnd sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismayed,\nThe reverend champion stood. At his control\nDespair and anguish fled the struggling soul;\nComfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,\nAnd his last faltering accents whispered praise.\n\nAt church, with meek and unaffected grace,\nHis looks adorned the venerable place;\nTruth from his lips prevailed with double sway,\nAnd fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray.\nThe service passed, around the pious man,\nWith steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;\nEven children followed with endearing wile,\nAnd plucked his gown, to share the good man's smile.\nHis ready smile a parent's warmth expressed,\nTheir welfare pleased him, and their cares distressed;\nTo them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,\nBut all his serious thoughts had rest in Heaven.\nAs some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,\nSwells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,\nThough round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,\nEternal sunshine settles on its head.\n\nBeside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,\nWith blossomed furze unprofitably gay,\nThere, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule,\nThe village master taught his little school;\nA man severe he was, and stern to view;\nI knew him well, and every truant knew;\nWell had the boding tremblers learned to trace\nThe day's disasters in his morning face;\nFull well they laughed, with counterfeited glee,\nAt all his jokes, for many a joke had he;\nFull well the busy whisper, circling round,\nConveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned;\nYet he was kind; or if severe in aught,\nThe love he bore to learning was in fault.\nThe village all declared how much he knew;\n'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too;\nLands he could measure, terms and tides presage,\nAnd even the story ran that he could gauge.\nIn arguing too, the parson owned his skill,\nFor e'en though vanquished, he could argue still;\nWhile words of learned length and thundering sound\nAmazed the gazing rustics ranged around,\nAnd still they gazed, and still the wonder grew\nThat one small head could carry all he knew.\n\nBut past is all his fame. The very spot\nWhere many a time he triumphed is forgot.\nNear yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,\nWhere once the signpost caught the passing eye,\nLow lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspired,\nWhere grey-beard mirth and smiling toil retired,\nWhere village statesmen talked with looks profound,\nAnd news much older than their ale went round.\nImagination fondly stoops to trace\nThe parlour splendours of that festive place:\nThe white-washed wall, the nicely sanded floor,\nThe varnished clock that clicked behind the door;\nThe chest contrived a double debt to pay,—\nA bed by night, a chest of drawers by day;\nThe pictures placed for ornament and use,\nThe twelve good rules, the royal game of goose;\nThe hearth, except when winter chilled the day,\nWith aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel gay;\nWhile broken teacups, wisely kept for show,\nRanged o'er the chimney, glistened in a row.\n\nVain transitory splendours! Could not all\nReprieve the tottering mansion from its fall!\nObscure it sinks, nor shall it more impart\nAn hour's importance to the poor man's heart;\nThither no more the peasant shall repair\nTo sweet oblivion of his daily care;\nNo more the farmer's news, the barber's tale,\nNo more the woodman's ballad shall prevail;\nNo more the smith his dusky brow shall clear,\nRelax his ponderous strength, and lean to hear;\nThe host himself no longer shall be found\nCareful to see the mantling bliss go round;\nNor the coy maid, half willing to be pressed,\nShall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest.\n\nYes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,\nThese simple blessings of the lowly train;\nTo me more dear, congenial to my heart,\nOne native charm, than all the gloss of art.\nSpontaneous joys, where Nature has its play,\nThe soul adopts, and owns their first-born sway;\nLightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind,\nUnenvied, unmolested, unconfined:\nBut the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,\nWith all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed,\nIn these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,\nThe toiling pleasure sickens into pain;\nAnd, even while fashion's brightest arts decoy,\nThe heart distrusting asks, if this be joy.\n\nYe friends to truth, ye statesmen, who survey\nThe rich man's joys increase, the poor's decay,\n'Tis yours to judge how wide the limits stand\nBetween a splendid and a happy land.\nProud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore,\nAnd shouting Folly hails them from her shore;\nHoards even beyond the miser's wish abound,\nAnd rich men flock from all the world around.\nYet count our gains. This wealth is but a name\nThat leaves our useful products still the same.\nNot so the loss. The man of wealth and pride\nTakes up a space that many poor supplied;\nSpace for his lake, his park's extended bounds,\nSpace for his horses, equipage, and hounds;\nThe robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth\nHas robbed the neighbouring fields of half their growth;\nHis seat, where solitary sports are seen,\nIndignant spurns the cottage from the green;\nAround the world each needful product flies,\nFor all the luxuries the world supplies:\nWhile thus the land adorned for pleasure, all\nIn barren splendour feebly waits the fall.\n\nAs some fair female unadorned and plain,\nSecure to please while youth confirms her reign,\nSlights every borrowed charm that dress supplies,\nNor shares with art the triumph of her eyes;\nBut when those charms are passed, for charms are frail,\nWhen time advances and when lovers fail,\nShe then shines forth, solicitous to bless,\nIn all the glaring impotence of dress.\nThus fares the land, by luxury betrayed,\nIn nature's simplest charms at first arrayed;\nBut verging to decline, its splendours rise,\nIts vistas strike, its palaces surprise;\nWhile, scourged by famine, from the smiling land\nThe mournful peasant leads his humble band;\nAnd while he sinks, without one arm to save,\nThe country blooms—a garden, and a grave.\n\nWhere then, ah! where, shall poverty reside,\nTo 'scape the pressure of contiguous pride?\nIf to some common's fenceless limits strayed,\nHe drives his flock to pick the scanty blade,\nThose fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide,\nAnd even the bare-worn common is denied.\nIf to the city sped—what waits him there?\nTo see profusion that he must not share;\nTo see ten thousand baneful arts combined\nTo pamper luxury, and thin mankind;\nTo see those joys the sons of pleasure know\nExtorted from his fellow creature's woe.\nHere, while the courtier glitters in brocade,\nThere the pale artist plies the sickly trade;\nHere, while the proud their long-drawn pomps display,\nThere the black gibbet glooms beside the way.\nThe dome where Pleasure holds her midnight reign\nHere, richly decked, admits the gorgeous train;\nTumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square,\nThe rattling chariots clash, the torches glare.\nSure scenes like these no troubles e'er annoy!\nSure these denote one universal joy!\nAre these thy serious thoughts?—Ah, turn thine eyes\nWhere the poor houseless shivering female lies.\nShe once, perhaps, in a village plenty blessed,\nHas wept at tales of innocence distressed;\nHer modest looks the cottage might adorn,\nSweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn;\nNow lost to all; her friends, her virtue fled,\nNear her betrayer's door she lays her head,\nAnd, pinched with cold, and shrinking from the shower,\nWith heavy heart deplores that luckless hour,\nWhen idly first, ambitious of the town,\nShe left her wheel and robes of country brown.\n\nDo thine, sweet Auburn, thine, the loveliest train,\nDo thy fair tribes participate her pain?\nE'en now, perhaps, by cold and hunger led,\nAt proud men's doors they ask a little bread!\n\nAh, no!—To distant climes, a dreary scene,\nWhere half the convex world intrudes between,\nThrough torrid tracts with fainting steps they go,\nWhere wild Altama murmurs to their woe.\nFar different there from all that charmed before,\nThe various terrors of that horrid shore;\nThose blazing suns that dart a downward ray\nAnd fiercely shed intolerable day;\nThose matted woods where birds forget to sing,\nBut silent bats in drowsy clusters cling;\nThose poisonous fields with rank luxuriance crowned,\nWhere the dark scorpion gathers death around;\nWhere at each step the stranger fears to wake\nThe rattling terrors of the vengeful snake;\nWhere crouching tigers wait their hapless prey,\nAnd savage men more murderous still than they;\nWhile oft in whirls the mad tornado flies,\nMingling the ravaged landscape with the skies.\nFar different these from every former scene,\nThe cooling brook, the grassy-vested green,\nThe breezy covert of the warbling grove,\nThat only sheltered thefts of harmless love.\n\nGood Heaven! what sorrows gloomed that parting day\nThat called them from their native walks away;\nWhen the poor exiles, every pleasure passed,\nHung round their bowers, and fondly looked their last,\nAnd took a long farewell, and wished in vain\nFor seats like these beyond the western main;\nAnd, shuddering still to face the distant deep,\nReturned and wept, and still returned to weep.\nThe good old sire, the first prepared to go\nTo new-found worlds, and wept for others' woe;\nBut for himself, in conscious virtue brave,\nHe only wished for worlds beyond the grave.\nHis lovely daughter, lovelier in her tears,\nThe fond companion of his helpless years,\nSilent went next, neglectful of her charms,\nAnd left a lover's for a father's arms.\nWith louder plaints the mother spoke her woes,\nAnd blessed the cot where every pleasure rose;\nAnd kissed her thoughtless babes with many a tear,\nAnd clasped them close, in sorrow doubly dear;\nWhilst her fond husband strove to lend relief\nIn all the silent manliness of grief.\n\nO luxury!

word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\nThe brave man with a sword!\n\nSome kill their love when they are young,\nAnd some when they are old;\nSome strangle with the hands of Lust,\nSome with the

sigh:\nFor each man kills the thing he loves,\nYet each man does not die.\n\nHe does not die a death of shame\nOn a day of dark disgrace,\nNor have a noose about his neck,\nNor a cloth upon his face,\nNor drop feet foremost through the floor\nInto an empty space.\n\n\nHe does not sit with silent men\nWho watch him night and day;\nWho watch him when he tries to weep,\nAnd when he tries to pray;\nWho watch him lest himself should rob\nThe prison of its prey.\n\nHe does not wake at dawn to see\nDread figures throng his room,\nThe shivering Chaplain robed in white,\nThe Sheriff stern with gloom,\nAnd the Governor all in shiny black,\nWith the yellow face of Doom.\n\nHe does not rise in piteous haste\nTo put on convict-clothes,\nWhile some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats,\nand notes\nEach new and nerve-twitched pose,\nFingering a watch whose little ticks\nAre like horrible hammer-blows.\n\nHe does not know that sickening thirst\nThat sands one's throat, before\nThe hangman with his gardener's gloves\nSlips through the padded door,\nAnd binds one with three leathern thongs,\nThat the throat may thirst no more.\n\nHe does not bend his head to hear\nThe Burial Office read,\nNor, while the terror of his soul\nTells him he is not dead,\nCross his own coffin, as he moves\nInto the hideous shed.\n\nHe does not stare upon the air\nThrough a little roof of glass:\nHe does not pray

was on his head,\nAnd his step seemed light and gay,\nBut I never saw a man who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\n\nI never saw a man who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every wandering cloud that trailed\nIts ravelled fleeces by.\n\nHe did not wring his hands, as do\nThose witless men who dare\nTo try to rear the changeling Hope\nIn the cave of black Despair:\nHe only looked upon the sun,\nAnd drank the morning air.\n\nHe did not wring his hands nor weep,\nNor did he peek or pine,\nBut he drank the air as though it held\nSome healthful anodyne;\nWith open mouth he drank the sun\nAs though it had been wine!\n\nAnd I and all the souls in pain,\nWho tramped the other ring,\nForgot if we ourselves had done\nA great or little thing,\nAnd watched with gaze of dull amaze\nThe man who had to swing.\n\nAnd strange it was to see him pass\nWith a step so light and gay,\nAnd strange it was to see him look\nSo wistfully at the day,\nAnd strange it was to think that he\nHad such a debt to pay.\n\n\nFor oak and elm have pleasant leaves\nThat in the springtime shoot:\nBut grim to see is the gallows-tree,\nWith its adder-bitten root,\nAnd, green or dry, a man must die\nBefore it bears its fruit!\n\nThe loftiest place is that seat of grace\nFor which all worldlings try:\nBut who would stand in hempen band\nUpon a scaffold high,\nAnd through a murderer's collar take\nHis last look at the sky?\n\nIt is sweet to dance to violins\nWhen Love and Life are fair:\nTo dance to flutes, to dance to lutes\nIs delicate and rare:\nBut it is not sweet with nimble feet\nTo dance upon the air!\n\nSo with curious eyes and sick surmise\nWe watched him day by day,\nAnd wondered if each one of us\nWould end the self-same way,\nFor none can tell to what red Hell\nHis sightless soul may stray.\n\nAt last the dead man walked no more\nAmongst the Trial Men,\nAnd I knew that he was standing up\nIn the black dock's dreadful pen,\nAnd that never would I see his face\nIn God's sweet world again.\n\nLike two doomed ships that pass in storm\nWe had crossed each other's way:\nBut we made no sign, we said no word,\nWe had no word to say;\nFor we did not meet in the holy night,\nBut in the shameful day.\n\nA prison wall was round us both,\nTwo outcast men we were:\nThe world had thrust us from its heart,\nAnd God from out His care:\nAnd the iron gin that waits for Sin\nHad caught us in its snare.\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIn Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,\nAnd the dripping wall is high,\nSo it was there he took the air\nBeneath the leaden sky,\nAnd by each side a Warder walked,\nFor fear the man might die.\n\nOr else he sat with those who watched\nHis anguish night and day;\nWho watched him when he rose to weep,\nAnd when he crouched to pray;\nWho watched him lest himself should rob\nTheir scaffold of its prey.\n\nThe Governor was strong upon\nThe Regulations Act:\nThe Doctor said that Death was but\nA scientific fact:\nAnd twice a day the Chaplain called,\nAnd left a little tract.\n\nAnd twice a day he smoked his pipe,\nAnd drank his quart of beer:\nHis soul was resolute, and held\nNo hiding-place for fear;\nHe often said that he was glad\nThe hangman's hands were near.\n\nBut why he said so strange a thing\nNo Warder dared to ask:\nFor he to whom a watcher's doom\nIs given as his task,\nMust set a lock upon his lips,\nAnd make his face a mask.\n\nOr else he might be moved, and try\nTo comfort or console:\nAnd what should Human Pity do\nPent up in Murderers' Hole?\nWhat word of grace in such a place\nCould help a brother's soul?\n\n\nWith slouch and swing around the ring\nWe trod the Fools' Parade!\nWe did not care: we knew we were\nThe Devil's Own Brigade:\nAnd shaven head and feet of lead\nMake a merry masquerade.\n\nWe tore the tarry rope to shreds\nWith blunt and bleeding nails;\nWe rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,\nAnd cleaned the shining rails:\nAnd, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,\nAnd clattered with the pails.\n\nWe sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,\nWe turned the dusty drill:\nWe banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,\nAnd sweated on the mill:\nBut in the heart of every man\nTerror was lying still.\n\nSo still it lay that every day\nCrawled like a weed-clogged wave:\nAnd we forgot the bitter lot\nThat waits for fool and knave,\nTill once, as we tramped in from work,\nWe passed an open grave.\n\nWith yawning mouth the yellow hole\nGaped for a living thing;\nThe very mud cried out for blood\nTo the thirsty asphalte ring:\nAnd we knew that ere one dawn grew fair\nSome prisoner had to swing.\n\nRight in we went, with soul intent\nOn Death and Dread and Doom:\nThe hangman, with his little bag,\nWent shuffling through the gloom:\nAnd each man trembled as he crept\nInto his numbered tomb.\n\n\nThat night the empty corridors\nWere full of forms of Fear,\nAnd up and down the iron town\nStole feet we could not hear,\nAnd through the bars that hide the stars\nWhite faces seemed to peer.\n\nHe lay as one who lies and dreams\nIn a pleasant meadow-land,\nThe watchers watched him as he slept,\nAnd could not understand\nHow one could sleep so sweet a sleep\nWith a hangman close at hand.\n\nBut there is no sleep when men must weep\nWho never yet have wept:\nSo we - the fool, the fraud, the knave -\nThat endless vigil kept,\nAnd through each brain on hands of pain\nAnother's terror crept.\n\nAlas! it is a fearful thing\nTo feel another's guilt!\nFor, right within, the sword of Sin\nPierced to its poisoned hilt,\nAnd as molten lead were the tears we shed\nFor the blood we had not spilt.\n\nThe Warders with their shoes of felt\nCrept by each padlocked door,\nAnd peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,\nGrey figures on the floor,\nAnd wondered why men knelt to pray\nWho never prayed before.\n\nAll through the night we knelt and prayed,\nMad mourners of a corse!\nThe troubled plumes of midnight were\nThe plumes upon a hearse:\nAnd bitter wine upon a sponge\nWas the savour of Remorse.\n\n\nThe grey cock crew, the red cock crew,\nBut never came the day:\nAnd crooked shapes of Terror crouched,\nIn the corners where we lay:\nAnd each evil sprite that walks by night\nBefore us seemed to play.\n\nThey glided past, they glided fast,\nLike travellers through a mist:\nThey mocked the moon in a rigadoon\nOf delicate turn and twist,\nAnd with formal pace and loathsome grace\nThe phantoms kept their tryst.\n\nWith mop and mow, we saw them go,\nSlim shadows hand in hand:\nAbout, about, in ghostly rout\nThey trod a saraband:\nAnd the damned grotesques made arabesques,\nLike the wind upon the sand!\n\nWith the pirouettes of marionettes,\nThey tripped on pointed tread:\nBut with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,\nAs their grisly masque they led,\nAnd loud they sang, and long they sang,\nFor they sang to wake the dead.\n\n'Oho!' they cried, 'The world is wide,\nBut fettered limbs go lame!\nAnd once, or twice, to throw the dice\nIs a gentlemanly game,\nBut he does not win who plays with Sin\nIn the secret House of Shame.'\n\nNo things of air these antics were,\nThat frolicked with such glee:\nTo men whose lives were held in gyves,\nAnd whose feet might not go free,\nAh! wounds of Christ! they were living things,\nMost terrible to see.\n\nAround, around, they waltzed and wound;\nSome wheeled in smirking pairs;\nWith the mincing step of a demirep\nSome sidled up the stairs:\nAnd with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,\nEach helped us at our prayers.\n\nThe morning wind began to moan,\nBut still the night went on:\nThrough its giant loom the web of gloom\nCrept till each thread was spun:\nAnd, as we prayed, we grew afraid\nOf the Justice of the Sun.\n\nThe moaning wind went wandering round\nThe weeping prison-wall:\nTill like a wheel of turning steel\nWe felt the minutes crawl:\nO moaning wind! what had we done\nTo have such a seneschal?\n\nAt last I saw the shadowed bars,\nLike a lattice wrought in lead,\nMove right across the whitewashed wall\nThat faced my three-plank bed,\nAnd I knew that somewhere in the world\nGod's dreadful dawn was red.\n\nAt six o'clock we cleaned our cells,\nAt seven all was still,\nBut the sough and swing of a mighty wing\nThe prison seemed to fill,\nFor the Lord of Death with icy breath\nHad entered in to kill.\n\nHe did not pass in purple pomp,\nNor ride a moon-white steed.\nThree yards of cord and a sliding board\nAre all the gallows' need:\nSo with rope of shame the Herald came\nTo do the secret deed.\n\nWe were as men who through a fen\nOf filthy darkness grope:\nWe did not dare to breathe a prayer,\nOr to give our anguish scope:\nSomething was dead in each of us,\nAnd what was dead was Hope.\n\nFor Man's grim Justice goes its way,\nAnd will not swerve aside:\nIt slays the weak, it slays the strong,\nIt has a deadly stride:\nWith iron heel it slays the strong,\nThe monstrous parricide!\n\nWe waited for the stroke of eight:\nEach tongue was thick with thirst:\nFor the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\nThat makes a man accursed,\nAnd Fate will use a running noose\nFor the best man and the worst.\n\nWe had no other thing to do,\nSave to wait for the sign to come:\nSo, like things of stone in a valley lone,\nQuiet we sat and dumb:\nBut each man's heart beat thick and quick,\nLike a madman on a drum!\n\nWith sudden shock the prison-clock\nSmote on the shivering air,\nAnd from all the gaol rose up a wail\nOf impotent despair,\nLike the sound that frightened marshes hear\nFrom some leper in his lair.\n\nAnd as one sees most fearful things\nIn the crystal of a dream,\nWe saw the greasy hempen rope\nHooked to the blackened beam,\nAnd heard the prayer the hangman's snare\nStrangled into a scream.\n\nAnd all the woe that moved him so\nThat he gave that bitter cry,\nAnd the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\nNone knew so well as I:\nFor he who lives more lives than one\nMore deaths than one must die.\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThere is no chapel on the day\nOn which they hang a man:\nThe Chaplain's heart is far too sick,\nOr his face is far too wan,\nOr there is that written in his eyes\nWhich none should look upon.\n\nSo they kept us close till nigh on noon,\nAnd then they rang the bell,\nAnd the Warders with their jingling keys\nOpened each listening cell,\nAnd down the iron stair we tramped,\nEach from his separate Hell.\n\nOut into God's sweet air we went,\nBut not in wonted way,\nFor this man's face was white with fear,\nAnd that man's face was grey,\nAnd I never saw sad men who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\n\nI never saw sad men who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWe prisoners called the sky,\nAnd at every careless cloud that passed\nIn happy freedom by.\n\nBut there were those amongst us all\nWho walked with downcast head,\nAnd knew that, had each got his due,\nThey should have died instead:\nHe had but killed a thing that lived,\nWhilst they had killed the dead.\n\nFor he who sins a second time\nWakes a dead soul to pain,\nAnd draws it from its spotted shroud,\nAnd makes it bleed again,\nAnd makes it bleed great gouts of blood,\nAnd makes it bleed in vain!\n\n\nLike ape or clown, in monstrous garb\nWith crooked arrows starred,\nSilently we went round and round\nThe slippery asphalte yard;\nSilently we went round and round,\nAnd no man spoke a word.\n\nSilently we went round and round,\nAnd through each hollow mind\nThe Memory of dreadful things\nRushed like a dreadful wind,\nAnd Horror stalked before each man,\nAnd Terror crept behind.\n\n\nThe Warders strutted up and down,\nAnd kept their herd of brutes,\nTheir uniforms were spick and span,\nAnd they wore their Sunday suits,\nBut we knew the work they had been at,\nBy the quicklime on their boots.\n\nFor where a grave had opened wide,\nThere was no grave at all:\nOnly a stretch of mud and sand\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\nAnd a little heap of burning lime,\nThat the man should have his pall.\n\nFor he has a pall, this wretched man,\nSuch as few men can claim:\nDeep down below a prison-yard,\nNaked for greater shame,\nHe lies, with fetters on each foot,\nWrapt in a sheet of flame!\n\nAnd all the while the burning lime\nEats flesh and bone away,\nIt eats the brittle bone by night,\nAnd the soft flesh by day,\nIt eats the flesh and bone by turns,\nBut it eats the heart alway.\n\n\nFor three long years they will not sow\nOr root or seedling there:\nFor three long years the unblessed spot\nWill sterile be and bare,\nAnd look upon the wondering sky\nWith unreproachful stare.\n\nThey think a murderer's heart would taint\nEach simple seed they sow.\nIt is not true! God's kindly earth\nIs kindlier than men know,\nAnd the red rose would but blow more red,\nThe white rose whiter blow.\n\nOut of his mouth a red, red rose!\nOut of his heart a white!\nFor who can say by what strange way,\nChrist brings His will to light,\nSince the barren staff the pilgrim bore\nBloomed in the great Pope's sight?\n\nBut neither milk-white rose nor red\nMay bloom in prison-air;\nThe shard, the pebble, and the flint,\nAre what they give us there:\nFor flowers have been known to heal\nA common man's despair.\n\nSo never will wine-red rose or white,\nPetal by petal, fall\nOn that stretch of mud and sand that lies\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\nTo tell the men who tramp the yard\nThat God's Son died for all.\n\n\nYet though the hideous prison-wall\nStill hems him round and round,\nAnd a spirit may not walk by night\nThat is with fetters bound,\nAnd a spirit may but weep that lies\nIn such unholy ground,\n\nHe is at peace - this wretched man -\nAt peace, or will be soon:\nThere is no thing to make him mad,\nNor does Terror walk at noon,\nFor the lampless Earth in which he lies\nHas neither Sun nor Moon.\n\nThey hanged him as a beast is hanged:\nThey did not even toll\nA requiem that might have brought\nRest to his startled soul,\nBut hurriedly they took him out,\nAnd hid him in a hole.\n\nThey stripped him of his canvas clothes,\nAnd gave him to the flies:\nThey mocked the swollen purple throat,\nAnd the stark and staring eyes:\nAnd with laughter loud they heaped the shroud\nIn which their convict lies.\n\nThe Chaplain would not kneel to pray\nBy his dishonoured grave:\nNor mark it with that blessed Cross\nThat Christ for sinners gave,\nBecause the man was one of those\nWhom Christ came down to save.\n\nYet all is well; he has but passed\nTo Life's appointed bourne:\nAnd alien tears will fill for him\nPity's long-broken urn,\nFor his mourners will be outcast men,\nAnd outcasts always mourn\n\n\nV\n\n\nI know not whether Laws be right,\nOr whether Laws be wrong;\nAll that we know who lie in gaol\nIs that the wall is strong;\nAnd that each day is like a year,\nA year whose days are long.\n\nBut this I know, that every Law\nThat men have made for Man,\nSince first Man took his brother's life,\nAnd the sad world began,\nBut straws the wheat and saves the chaff\nWith a most evil fan.\n\nThis too I know - and wise it were\nIf each could know the same -\nThat every prison that men build\nIs built with bricks of shame,\nAnd bound with bars lest Christ should see\nHow men their brothers maim.\n\nWith bars they blur the gracious moon,\nAnd blind the goodly sun:\nAnd they do well to hide their Hell,\nFor in it things are done\nThat Son of God nor son of Man\nEver should look upon!\n\n\nThe vilest deeds like poison weeds,\nBloom well in prison-air;\nIt is only what is good in Man\nThat wastes and withers there:\nPale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\nAnd the Warder is Despair.\n\nFor they starve the little frightened child\nTill it weeps both night and day:\nAnd they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,\nAnd gibe the old and grey,\nAnd some grow mad, and all grow bad,\nAnd none a word may say.\n\nEach narrow cell in which we dwell\nIs a foul and dark latrine,\nAnd the fetid breath of living Death\nChokes up each grated screen,\nAnd all, but Lust, is turned to dust\nIn Humanity's machine.\n\nThe brackish water that we drink\nCreeps with a loathsome slime,\nAnd the bitter bread they weigh in scales\nIs full of chalk and lime,\nAnd Sleep will not lie down, but walks\nWild-eyed, and cries to Time.\n\n\nBut though lean Hunger and green Thirst\nLike asp with adder fight,\nWe have little care of prison fare,\nFor what chills and kills outright\nIs that every stone one lifts by day\nBecomes one's heart by night.\n\nWith midnight always in one's heart,\nAnd twilight in one's cell,\nWe turn the crank, or tear the rope,\nEach in his separate Hell,\nAnd the silence is more awful far\nThan the sound of a brazen bell.\n\nAnd never a human voice comes near\nTo speak a gentle word:\nAnd the eye that watches through the door\nIs pitiless and hard:\nAnd by all forgot, we rot and rot,\nWith soul and body marred.\n\nAnd thus we rust Life's iron chain\nDegraded and alone:\nAnd some men curse, and some men weep,\nAnd some men make no moan:\nBut God's eternal Laws are kind\nAnd break the heart of stone.\n\n\nAnd every human heart that breaks,\nIn prison-cell or yard,\nIs as that broken box that gave\nIts treasure to the Lord,\nAnd filled the unclean leper's house\nWith the scent of costliest nard.\n\nAh! happy they whose hearts can break\nAnd peace of pardon win!\nHow else may man make straight his plan\nAnd cleanse his soul from Sin?\nHow else but through a broken heart\nMay Lord Christ enter in?\n\n\nAnd he of the swollen purple throat,\nAnd the stark and staring eyes,\nWaits for the holy hands that took\nThe Thief to Paradise;\nAnd a broken and a contrite heart\nThe Lord will not despise.\n\nThe man in red who reads the Law\nGave him three weeks of life,\nThree little weeks in which to heal\nHis soul of his soul's strife,\nAnd cleanse from every blot of blood\nThe hand that held the knife.\n\nAnd with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,\nThe hand that held the steel:\nFor only blood can wipe out blood,\nAnd only tears can heal:\nAnd the crimson stain that was of Cain\nBecame Christ's snow-white seal.\n\n\nVI\n\n\nIn Reading gaol by Reading town\nThere is a pit of shame,\nAnd in it lies a wretched man\nEaten by teeth of flame,\nIn a burning winding-sheet he lies,\nAnd his grave has got no name.\n\nAnd there, till Christ call forth the dead,\nIn silence let him lie:\nNo need to waste the foolish tear,\nOr heave the windy sigh:\nThe man had killed the thing he loved,\nAnd so he had to die.\n\nAnd all men kill the thing they love,\nBy all let this be heard,\nSome do it with a bitter look,\nSome with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\nThe brave man with a sword!","title":"The Ballad Of Reading Gaol"},{"lines":"The silver trumpets rang across the Dome:\nThe people knelt upon the ground with awe:\nAnd borne upon the necks of men I saw,\nLike some great God, the Holy Lord of Rome.\nPriest-like, he wore a robe more white than foam,\nAnd, king-like, swathed himself in royal red,\nThree crowns of gold rose high upon his head:\nIn splendour and in light the Pope passed home.\nMy heart stole back across wide wastes of years\nTo One who wandered by a lonely sea,\nAnd sought in vain for any place of rest:\n'Foxes

harden\nAll the loveless land,\nIt will whisper of the garden,\nYou will understand.","title":"To My Wife - With A Copy Of My Poems"},{"lines":"I.\n\nHe was a Grecian lad, who coming home\nWith pulpy figs and wine from Sicily\nStood at his galley's prow, and let the foam\nBlow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously,\nAnd holding wave and wind in boy's despite\nPeered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night.\n\nTill with the dawn he saw a burnished spear\nLike a thin thread of gold against the sky,\nAnd hoisted sail, and strained the creaking gear,\nAnd bade the pilot head her lustily\nAgainst the nor'west gale, and all day long\nHeld on his way, and marked the rowers' time with measured song.\n\nAnd when the faint Corinthian hills were red\nDropped anchor in a little sandy bay,\nAnd with fresh boughs of olive crowned his head,\nAnd brushed from cheek and throat the hoary spray,\nAnd washed his limbs with oil, and from the hold\nBrought out his linen tunic and his sandals brazen-soled,\n\nAnd a rich robe stained with the fishers' juice\nWhich of some swarthy trader he had bought\nUpon the sunny quay at Syracuse,\nAnd was with Tyrian broideries inwrought,\nAnd by the questioning merchants made his way\nUp through the soft and silver woods, and when the labouring day\n\nHad spun its tangled web of crimson cloud,\nClomb the high hill, and with swift silent feet\nCrept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd\nOf busy priests, and from some dark retreat\nWatched the young swains his frolic playmates bring\nThe firstling of their little flock, and the shy shepherd fling\n\nThe crackling salt upon the flame, or hang\nHis studded crook against the temple wall\nTo Her who keeps away the ravenous fang\nOf the base wolf from homestead and from stall;\nAnd then the clear-voiced maidens 'gan to sing,\nAnd to the altar each man brought some goodly offering,\n\nA beechen cup brimming with milky foam,\nA fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery\nOf hounds in chase, a waxen honey-comb\nDripping with oozy gold which scarce the bee\nHad ceased from building, a black skin of oil\nMeet for the wrestlers, a great boar the fierce and white-tusked\nspoil\n\nStolen from Artemis that jealous maid\nTo please Athena, and the dappled hide\nOf a tall stag who in some mountain glade\nHad met the shaft; and then the herald cried,\nAnd from the pillared precinct one by one\nWent the glad Greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had\ndone.\n\nAnd the old priest put out the waning fires\nSave that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed\nFor ever in the cell, and the shrill lyres\nCame fainter on the wind, as down the road\nIn joyous dance these country folk did pass,\nAnd with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass.\n\nLong time he lay and hardly dared to breathe,\nAnd heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine,\nAnd the rose-petals falling from the wreath\nAs the night breezes wandered through the shrine,\nAnd seemed to be in some entranced swoon\nTill through the open roof above the full and brimming moon\n\nFlooded with sheeny waves the marble floor,\nWhen from his nook up leapt the venturous lad,\nAnd flinging wide the cedar-carven door\nBeheld an awful image saffron-clad\nAnd armed for battle! the gaunt Griffin glared\nFrom the huge helm, and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared\n\nLike a red rod of flame, stony and steeled\nThe Gorgon's head its leaden eyeballs rolled,\nAnd writhed its snaky horrors through the shield,\nAnd gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold\nIn passion impotent, while with blind gaze\nThe blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze.\n\nThe lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp\nFar out at sea off Sunium, or cast\nThe net for tunnies, heard a brazen tramp\nOf horses smite the waves, and a wild blast\nDivide the folded curtains of the night,\nAnd knelt upon the little poop, and prayed in holy fright.\n\nAnd guilty lovers in their venery\nForgat a little while their stolen sweets,\nDeeming they heard dread Dian's bitter cry;\nAnd the grim watchmen on their lofty seats\nRan to their shields in haste precipitate,\nOr strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet.\n\nFor round the temple rolled the clang of arms,\nAnd the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear,\nAnd the air quaked with dissonant alarums\nTill huge Poseidon shook his mighty spear,\nAnd on the frieze the prancing horses neighed,\nAnd the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade.\n\nReady for death with parted lips he stood,\nAnd well content at such a price to see\nThat calm wide brow, that terrible maidenhood,\nThe marvel of that pitiless chastity,\nAh! well content indeed, for never wight\nSince Troy's young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight.\n\nReady for death he stood, but lo! the air\nGrew silent, and the horses ceased to neigh,\nAnd off his brow he tossed the clustering hair,\nAnd from his limbs he throw the cloak away;\nFor whom would not such love make desperate?\nAnd nigher came, and touched her throat, and with hands violate\n\nUndid the cuirass, and the crocus gown,\nAnd bared the breasts of polished ivory,\nTill from the waist the peplos falling down\nLeft visible the secret mystery\nWhich to no lover will Athena show,\nThe grand cool flanks, the crescent thighs, the bossy hills of\nsnow.\n\nThose who have never known a lover's sin\nLet them not read my ditty, it will be\nTo their dull ears so musicless and thin\nThat they will have no joy of it, but ye\nTo whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile,\nYe who have learned who Eros is, - O listen yet awhile.\n\nA little space he let his greedy eyes\nRest on the burnished image, till mere sight\nHalf swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,\nAnd then his lips in hungering delight\nFed on her lips, and round the towered neck\nHe flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion's will to check.\n\nNever I ween did lover hold such tryst,\nFor all night long he murmured honeyed word,\nAnd saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed\nHer pale and argent body undisturbed,\nAnd paddled with the polished throat, and pressed\nHis hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.\n\nIt was as if Numidian javelins\nPierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,\nAnd his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins\nIn exquisite pulsation, and the pain\nWas such sweet anguish that he never drew\nHis lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.\n\nThey who have never seen the daylight peer\nInto a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,\nAnd with dull eyes and wearied from some dear\nAnd worshipped body risen, they for certain\nWill never know of what I try to sing,\nHow long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering.\n\nThe moon was girdled with a crystal rim,\nThe sign which shipmen say is ominous\nOf wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,\nAnd the low lightening east was tremulous\nWith the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,\nEre from the silent sombre shrine his lover had withdrawn.\n\nDown the steep rock with hurried feet and fast\nClomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,\nAnd heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,\nAnd leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran\nLike a young fawn unto an olive wood\nWhich in a shady valley by the well-built city stood;\n\nAnd sought a little stream, which well he knew,\nFor oftentimes with boyish careless shout\nThe green and crested grebe he would pursue,\nOr snare in woven net the silver trout,\nAnd down amid the startled reeds he lay\nPanting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day.\n\nOn the green bank he lay, and let one hand\nDip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,\nAnd soon the breath of morning came and fanned\nHis hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly\nThe tangled curls from off his forehead, while\nHe on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.\n\nAnd soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak\nWith his long crook undid the wattled cotes,\nAnd from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke\nCurled through the air across the ripening oats,\nAnd on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed\nAs through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed.\n\nAnd when the light-foot mower went afield\nAcross the meadows laced with threaded dew,\nAnd the sheep bleated on the misty weald,\nAnd from its nest the waking corncrake flew,\nSome woodmen saw him lying by the stream\nAnd marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,\n\nNor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,\n'It is young Hylas, that false runaway\nWho with a Naiad now would make his bed\nForgetting Herakles,' but others, 'Nay,\nIt is Narcissus, his own paramour,\nThose are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure.'\n\nAnd when they nearer came a third one cried,\n'It is young Dionysos who has hid\nHis spear and fawnskin by the river side\nWeary of hunting with the Bassarid,\nAnd wise indeed were we away to fly:\nThey live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy.'\n\nSo turned they back, and feared to look behind,\nAnd told the timid swain how they had seen\nAmid the reeds some woodland god reclined,\nAnd no man dared to cross the open green,\nAnd on that day no olive-tree was slain,\nNor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain,\n\nSave when the neat-herd's lad, his empty pail\nWell slung upon his back, with leap and bound\nRaced on the other side, and stopped to hail,\nHoping that he some comrade new had found,\nAnd gat no answer, and then half afraid\nPassed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade\n\nA little girl ran laughing from the farm,\nNot thinking of love's secret mysteries,\nAnd when she saw the white and gleaming arm\nAnd all his manlihood, with longing eyes\nWhose passion mocked her sweet virginity\nWatched him awhile, and then stole back sadly and wearily.\n\nFar off he heard the city's hum and noise,\nAnd now and then the shriller laughter where\nThe passionate purity of brown-limbed boys\nWrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,\nAnd now and then a little tinkling bell\nAs the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.\n\nThrough the grey willows danced the fretful gnat,\nThe grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,\nIn sleek and oily coat the water-rat\nBreasting the little ripples manfully\nMade for the wild-duck's nest, from bough to bough\nHopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the\nslough.\n\nOn the faint wind floated the silky seeds\nAs the bright scythe swept through the waving grass,\nThe ouzel-cock splashed circles in the reeds\nAnd flecked with silver whorls the forest's glass,\nWhich scarce had caught again its imagery\nEre from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragon-fly.\n\nBut little care had he for any thing\nThough up and down the beech the squirrel played,\nAnd from the copse the linnet 'gan to sing\nTo its brown mate its sweetest serenade;\nAh! little care indeed, for he had seen\nThe breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.\n\nBut when the herdsman called his straggling goats\nWith whistling pipe across the rocky road,\nAnd the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes\nBoomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to bode\nOf coming storm, and the belated crane\nPassed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain\n\nFell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he rose,\nAnd from the gloomy forest went his way\nPast sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,\nAnd came at last unto a little quay,\nAnd called his mates aboard, and took his seat\nOn the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping\nsheet,\n\nAnd steered across the bay, and when nine suns\nPassed down the long and laddered way of gold,\nAnd nine pale moons had breathed their orisons\nTo the chaste stars their confessors, or told\nTheir dearest secret to the downy moth\nThat will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging froth\n\nCame a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes\nAnd lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked\nAs though the lading of three argosies\nWere in the hold, and flapped its wings and shrieked,\nAnd darkness straightway stole across the deep,\nSheathed was Orion's sword, dread Mars himself fled down the steep,\n\nAnd the moon hid behind a tawny mask\nOf drifting cloud, and from the ocean's marge\nRose the red plume, the huge and horned casque,\nThe seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!\nAnd clad in bright and burnished panoply\nAthena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!\n\nTo the dull sailors' sight her loosened looks\nSeemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet\nOnly the spume that floats on hidden rocks,\nAnd, marking how the rising waters beat\nAgainst the rolling ship, the pilot cried\nTo the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side\n\nBut he, the overbold adulterer,\nA dear profaner of great mysteries,\nAn ardent amorous idolater,\nWhen he beheld those grand relentless eyes\nLaughed loud for joy, and crying out 'I come'\nLeapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.\n\nThen fell from the high heaven one bright star,\nOne dancer left the circling galaxy,\nAnd back to Athens on her clattering car\nIn all the pride of venged divinity\nPale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,\nAnd a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.\n\nAnd the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew\nWith mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,\nAnd the old pilot bade the trembling crew\nHoist the big sail, and told how he had seen\nClose to the stern a dim and giant form,\nAnd like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm.\n\nAnd no man dared to speak of Charmides\nDeeming that he some evil thing had wrought,\nAnd when they reached the strait Symplegades\nThey beached their galley on the shore, and sought\nThe toll-gate of the city hastily,\nAnd in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nBut some good Triton-god had ruth, and bare\nThe boy's drowned body back to Grecian land,\nAnd mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair\nAnd smoothed his brow, and loosed his clenching hand;\nSome brought sweet spices from far Araby,\nAnd others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby.\n\nAnd when he neared his old Athenian home,\nA mighty billow rose up suddenly\nUpon whose oily back the clotted foam\nLay diapered in some strange fantasy,\nAnd clasping him unto its glassy breast\nSwept landward, like a white-maned steed upon a venturous quest!\n\nNow where Colonos leans unto the sea\nThere lies a long and level stretch of lawn;\nThe rabbit knows it, and the mountain bee\nFor it deserts Hymettus, and the Faun\nIs not afraid, for never through the day\nComes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play.\n\nBut often from the thorny labyrinth\nAnd tangled branches of the circling wood\nThe stealthy hunter sees young Hyacinth\nHurling the polished disk, and draws his hood\nOver his guilty gaze, and creeps away,\nNor dares to wind his horn, or - else at the first break of day\n\nThe Dryads come and throw the leathern ball\nAlong the reedy shore, and circumvent\nSome goat-eared Pan to be their seneschal\nFor fear of bold Poseidon's ravishment,\nAnd loose their girdles, with shy timorous eyes,\nLest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise.\n\nOn this side and on that a rocky cave,\nHung with the yellow-belled laburnum, stands\nSmooth is the beach, save where some ebbing wave\nLeaves its faint outline etched upon the sands,\nAs though it feared to be too soon forgot\nBy the green rush, its playfellow, - and yet, it is a spot\n\nSo small, that the inconstant butterfly\nCould steal the hoarded money from each flower\nEre it was noon, and still not satisfy\nIts over-greedy love, - within an hour\nA sailor boy, were he but rude enow\nTo land and pluck a garland for his galley's painted prow,\n\nWould almost leave the little meadow bare,\nFor it knows nothing of great pageantry,\nOnly a few narcissi here and there\nStand separate in sweet austerity,\nDotting the unmown grass with silver stars,\nAnd here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimitars.\n\nHither the billow brought him, and was glad\nOf such dear servitude, and where the land\nWas virgin of all waters laid the lad\nUpon the golden margent of the strand,\nAnd like a lingering lover oft returned\nTo kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned,\n\nEre the wet seas had quenched that holocaust,\nThat self-fed flame, that passionate lustihead,\nEre grisly death with chill and nipping frost\nHad withered up those lilies white and red\nWhich, while the boy would through the forest range,\nAnswered each other in a sweet antiphonal counter-change.\n\nAnd when at dawn the wood-nymphs, hand-in-hand,\nThreaded the bosky dell, their satyr spied\nThe boy's pale body stretched upon the sand,\nAnd feared Poseidon's treachery, and cried,\nAnd like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade\nEach startled Dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade.\n\nSave one white girl, who deemed it would not be\nSo dread a thing to feel a sea-god's arms\nCrushing her breasts in amorous tyranny,\nAnd longed to listen to those subtle charms\nInsidious lovers weave when they would win\nSome fenced fortress, and stole back again, nor thought it sin\n\nTo yield her treasure unto one so fair,\nAnd lay beside him, thirsty with love's drouth,\nCalled him soft names, played with his tangled hair,\nAnd with hot lips made havoc of his mouth\nAfraid he might not wake, and then afraid\nLest he might wake too soon, fled back, and then, fond renegade,\n\nReturned to fresh assault, and all day long\nSat at his side, and laughed at her new toy,\nAnd held his hand, and sang her sweetest song,\nThen frowned to see how froward was the boy\nWho would not with her maidenhood entwine,\nNor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on Proserpine;\n\nNor knew what sacrilege his lips had done,\nBut said, 'He will awake, I know him well,\nHe will awake at evening when the sun\nHangs his red shield on Corinth's citadel;\nThis sleep is but a cruel treachery\nTo make me love him more, and in some cavern of the sea\n\nDeeper than ever falls the fisher's line\nAlready a huge Triton blows his horn,\nAnd weaves a garland from the crystalline\nAnd drifting ocean-tendrils to adorn\nThe emerald pillars of our bridal bed,\nFor sphered in foaming silver, and with coral crowned head,\n\nWe two will sit upon a throne of pearl,\nAnd a blue wave will be our canopy,\nAnd at our feet the water-snakes will curl\nIn all their amethystine panoply\nOf diamonded mail, and we will mark\nThe mullets swimming by the mast of some storm-foundered bark,\n\nVermilion-finned with eyes of bossy gold\nLike flakes of crimson light, and the great deep\nHis glassy-portaled chamber will unfold,\nAnd we will see the painted dolphins sleep\nCradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks\nWhere Proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous\nflocks.\n\nAnd tremulous opal-hued anemones\nWill wave their purple fringes where we tread\nUpon the mirrored floor, and argosies\nOf fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread\nThe drifting cordage of the shattered wreck,\nAnd honey-coloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck.'\n\nBut when that baffled Lord of War the Sun\nWith gaudy pennon flying passed away\nInto his brazen House, and one by one\nThe little yellow stars began to stray\nAcross the field of heaven, ah! then indeed\nShe feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed,\n\nAnd cried, 'Awake, already the pale moon\nWashes the trees with silver, and the wave\nCreeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune,\nThe croaking frogs are out, and from the cave\nThe nightjar shrieks, the fluttering bats repass,\nAnd the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky\ngrass.\n\nNay, though thou art a god, be not so coy,\nFor in yon stream there is a little reed\nThat often whispers how a lovely boy\nLay with her once upon a grassy mead,\nWho when his cruel pleasure he had done\nSpread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun.\n\nBe not so coy, the laurel trembles still\nWith great Apollo's kisses, and the fir\nWhose clustering sisters fringe the seaward hill\nHath many a tale of that bold ravisher\nWhom men call Boreas, and I have seen\nThe mocking eyes of Hermes through the poplar's silvery sheen.\n\nEven the jealous Naiads call me fair,\nAnd every morn a young and ruddy swain\nWoos me with apples and with locks of hair,\nAnd seeks to soothe my virginal disdain\nBy all the gifts the gentle wood-nymphs love;\nBut yesterday he brought to me an iris-plumaged dove\n\nWith little crimson feet, which with its store\nOf seven spotted eggs the cruel lad\nHad stolen from the lofty sycamore\nAt daybreak, when her amorous comrade had\nFlown off in search of berried juniper\nWhich most they love; the fretful wasp, that earliest vintager\n\nOf the blue grapes, hath not persistency\nSo constant as this simple shepherd-boy\nFor my poor lips, his joyous purity\nAnd laughing sunny eyes might well decoy\nA Dryad from her oath to Artemis;\nFor very beautiful is he, his mouth was made to kiss;\n\nHis argent forehead, like a rising moon\nOver the dusky hills of meeting brows,\nIs crescent shaped, the hot and Tyrian noon\nLeads from the myrtle-grove no goodlier spouse\nFor Cytheraea, the first silky down\nFringes his blushing cheeks, and his young limbs are strong and\nbrown;\n\nAnd he is rich, and fat and fleecy herds\nOf bleating sheep upon his meadows lie,\nAnd many an earthen bowl of yellow curds\nIs in his homestead for the thievish fly\nTo swim and drown in, the pink clover mead\nKeeps its sweet store for him, and he can pipe on oaten reed.\n\nAnd yet I love him not; it was for thee\nI kept my love; I knew that thou would'st come\nTo rid me of this pallid chastity,\nThou fairest flower of the flowerless foam\nOf all the wide AEgean, brightest star\nOf ocean's azure heavens where the mirrored planets are!\n\nI knew that thou would'st come, for when at first\nThe dry wood burgeoned, and the sap of spring\nSwelled in my green and tender bark or burst\nTo myriad multitudinous blossoming\nWhich mocked the midnight with its mimic moons\nThat did not dread the dawn, and first the thrushes' rapturous\ntunes\n\nStartled the squirrel from its granary,\nAnd cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane,\nThrough my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy\nCrept like new wine, and every mossy vein\nThrobbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood,\nAnd the wild winds of passion shook my slim stem's maidenhood.\n\nThe trooping fawns at evening came and laid\nTheir cool black noses on my lowest boughs,\nAnd on my topmost branch the blackbird made\nA little nest of grasses for his spouse,\nAnd now and then a twittering wren would light\nOn a thin twig which hardly bare the weight of such delight.\n\nI was the Attic shepherd's trysting place,\nBeneath my shadow Amaryllis lay,\nAnd round my trunk would laughing Daphnis chase\nThe timorous girl, till tired out with play\nShe felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair,\nAnd turned, and looked, and fled no more from such delightful\nsnare.\n\nThen come away unto my ambuscade\nWhere clustering woodbine weaves a canopy\nFor amorous pleasaunce, and the rustling shade\nOf Paphian myrtles seems to sanctify\nThe dearest rites of love; there in the cool\nAnd green recesses of its farthest depth there is pool,\n\nThe ouzel's haunt, the wild bee's pasturage,\nFor round its rim great creamy lilies float\nThrough their flat leaves in verdant anchorage,\nEach cup a white-sailed golden-laden boat\nSteered by a dragon-fly, - be not afraid\nTo leave this wan and wave-kissed shore, surely the place was made\n\nFor lovers such as we; the Cyprian Queen,\nOne arm around her boyish paramour,\nStrays often there at eve, and I have seen\nThe moon strip off her misty vestiture\nFor young Endymion's eyes; be not afraid,\nThe panther feet of Dian never tread that secret glade.\n\nNay if thou will'st, back to the beating brine,\nBack to the boisterous billow let us go,\nAnd walk all day beneath the hyaline\nHuge vault of Neptune's watery portico,\nAnd watch the purple monsters of the deep\nSport in ungainly play, and from his lair keen Xiphias leap.\n\nFor if my mistress find me lying here\nShe will not ruth or gentle pity show,\nBut lay her boar-spear down, and with austere\nRelentless fingers string the cornel bow,\nAnd draw the feathered notch against her breast,\nAnd loose the arched cord; aye, even now upon the quest\n\nI hear her hurrying feet, - awake, awake,\nThou laggard in love's battle! once at least\nLet me drink deep of passion's wine, and slake\nMy parched being with the nectarous feast\nWhich even gods affect! O come, Love, come,\nStill we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home.'\n\nScarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees\nShook, and the leaves divided, and the air\nGrew conscious of a god, and the grey seas\nCrawled backward, and a long and dismal blare\nBlew from some tasselled horn, a sleuth-hound bayed,\nAnd like a flame a barbed reed flew whizzing down the glade.\n\nAnd where the little flowers of her breast\nJust brake into their milky blossoming,\nThis murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,\nPierced and struck deep in horrid chambering,\nAnd ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart,\nAnd dug a long red road, and cleft with winged death her heart.\n\nSobbing her life out with a bitter cry\nOn the boy's body fell the Dryad maid,\nSobbing for incomplete virginity,\nAnd raptures unenjoyed, and pleasures dead,\nAnd all the pain of things unsatisfied,\nAnd the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing\nside.\n\nAh! pitiful it was to hear her moan,\nAnd very pitiful to see her die\nEre she had yielded up her sweets, or known\nThe joy of passion, that dread mystery\nWhich not to know is not to live at all,\nAnd yet to know is to be held in death's most deadly thrall.\n\nBut as it hapt the Queen of Cythere,\nWho with Adonis all night long had lain\nWithin some shepherd's hut in Arcady,\nOn team of silver doves and gilded wain\nWas journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar\nFrom mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,\n\nAnd when low down she spied the hapless pair,\nAnd heard the Oread's faint despairing cry,\nWhose cadence seemed to play upon the air\nAs though it were a viol, hastily\nShe bade her pigeons fold each straining plume,\nAnd dropt to earth, and reached the strand, and saw their dolorous\ndoom.\n\nFor as a gardener turning back his head\nTo catch the last notes of the linnet, mows\nWith careless scythe too near some flower bed,\nAnd cuts the thorny pillar of the rose,\nAnd with the flower's loosened loneliness\nStrews the brown mould; or as some shepherd lad in wantonness\n\nDriving his little flock along the mead\nTreads down two daffodils, which side by aide\nHave lured the lady-bird with yellow brede\nAnd made the gaudy moth forget its pride,\nTreads down their brimming golden chalices\nUnder light feet which were not made for such rude ravages;\n\nOr as a schoolboy tired of his book\nFlings himself down upon the reedy grass\nAnd plucks two water-lilies from the brook,\nAnd for a time forgets the hour glass,\nThen wearies of their sweets, and goes his way,\nAnd lets the hot sun kill them, even go these lovers lay.\n\nAnd Venus cried, 'It is dread Artemis\nWhose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty,\nOr else that mightier maid whose care it is\nTo guard her strong and stainless majesty\nUpon the hill Athenian, - alas!\nThat they who loved so well unloved into Death's house should\npass.'\n\nSo with soft hands she laid the boy and girl\nIn the great golden waggon tenderly\n(Her white throat whiter than a moony pearl\nJust threaded with a blue vein's tapestry\nHad not yet ceased to throb, and still her breast\nSwayed like a wind-stirred lily in ambiguous unrest)\n\nAnd then each pigeon spread its milky van,\nThe bright car soared into the dawning sky,\nAnd like a cloud the aerial caravan\nPassed over the AEgean silently,\nTill the faint air was troubled with the song\nFrom the wan mouths that call on bleeding Thammuz all night long.\n\nBut when the doves had reached their wonted goal\nWhere the wide stair of orbed marble dips\nIts snows into the sea, her fluttering soul\nJust shook the trembling petals of her lips\nAnd passed into the void, and Venus knew\nThat one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue,\n\nAnd bade her servants carve a cedar chest\nWith all the wonder of this history,\nWithin whose scented womb their limbs should rest\nWhere olive-trees make tender the blue sky\nOn the low hills of Paphos, and the Faun\nPipes in the noonday, and the nightingale sings on till dawn.\n\nNor failed they to obey her hest, and ere\nThe morning bee had stung the daffodil\nWith tiny fretful spear, or from its lair\nThe waking stag had leapt across the rill\nAnd roused the ouzel, or the lizard crept\nAthwart the sunny rock, beneath the grass their bodies slept.\n\nAnd when day brake, within that silver shrine\nFed by the flames of cressets tremulous,\nQueen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine\nThat she whose beauty made Death amorous\nShould beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,\nAnd let Desire pass across dread Charon's icy ford.\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIn melancholy moonless Acheron,\nFarm for the goodly earth and joyous day\nWhere no spring ever buds, nor ripening sun\nWeighs down the apple trees, nor flowery May\nChequers with chestnut blooms the grassy floor,\nWhere thrushes never sing, and piping linnets mate no more,\n\nThere by a dim and dark Lethaean well\nYoung Charmides was lying;

I see thee stand\nBy this lone lake, in this far land,\nThy loose hair in the light wind flying,\nThy sweet voice to each tone of even\nUnited, and thine eyes replying\nTo the hues of yon fair heaven.\nCome, gentle friend: wilt sit by me?\nAnd be as thou wert wont to be\nEre we were disunited?\nNone doth behold us now; the power\nThat led us forth at this lone hour\nWill be but ill requited\nIf thou depart in scorn: oh! come,\nAnd talk of our abandoned home.\nRemember, this is Italy,\nAnd we are exiles. Talk with me\nOf that our land, whose wilds and floods,\nBarren and dark although they be,\nWere dearer than these chestnut woods:\nThose heathy paths, that inland stream,\nAnd the blue mountains, shapes which seem\nLike wrecks of childhood's sunny dream:\nWhich that we have abandoned now,\nWeighs on the heart like that remorse\nWhich altered friendship leaves. I seek\nNo more our youthful intercourse.\nThat cannot be! Rosalind, speak.\nSpeak to me. Leave me not.--When morn did come,\nWhen evening fell upon our common home,\nWhen for one hour we parted,--do not frown:\nI would not chide thee, though thy faith is broken:\nBut turn to me. Oh! by this cherished token,\nOf woven hair, which thou wilt not disown,\nTurn, as 'twere but the memory of me,\nAnd not my scorned self who prayed to thee.\n\nROSALIND:\nIs it a dream, or do I see\nAnd hear frail Helen? I would flee\nThy tainting touch; but former years\nArise, and bring forbidden tears;\nAnd my o'erburthened memory\nSeeks yet its lost repose in thee.\nI share thy crime. I cannot choose\nBut weep for thee: mine own strange grief\nBut seldom stoops to such relief:\nNor ever did I love thee less,\nThough mourning o'er thy wickedness\nEven with a sister's woe. I knew\nWhat to the evil world is due,\nAnd therefore sternly did refuse\nTo link me with the infamy\nOf one so lost as Helen. Now\nBewildered by my dire despair,\nWondering I blush, and weep that thou\nShould'st love me still,--thou only!--There,\nLet us sit on that gray stone\nTill our mournful talk be done.\n\nHELEN:\nAlas! not there; I cannot bear\nThe murmur of this lake to hear.\nA sound from there, Rosalind dear,\nWhich never yet I heard elsewhere\nBut in our native land, recurs,\nEven here where now we meet. It stirs\nToo much of suffocating sorrow!\nIn the dell of yon dark chestnutwood\nIs a stone seat, a solitude\nLess like our own. The ghost of Peace\nWill not desert this spot. To-morrow,\nIf thy kind feelings should not cease,\nWe may sit here.\n\nROSALIND:\nThou lead, my sweet,\nAnd I will follow.\n\nHENRY:\n'Tis Fenici's seat\nWhere you are going? This is not the way,\nMamma; it leads behind those trees that grow\nClose to the little river.\n\nHELEN:\nYes: I know;\nI was bewildered. Kiss me and be gay,\nDear boy: why do you sob?\n\nHENRY:\nI do not know:\nBut it might break any one's heart to see\nYou and the lady cry so bitterly.\n\nHELEN:\nIt is a gentle child, my friend. Go home,\nHenry, and play with Lilla till I come.\nWe only cried with joy to see each other;\nWe are quite merry now: Good-night.\n\nThe boy\nLifted a sudden look upon his mother,\nAnd in the gleam of forced and hollow joy\nWhich lightened o'er her face, laughed with the glee\nOf light and unsuspecting infancy,\nAnd whispered in her ear, 'Bring home with you\nThat sweet strange lady-friend.' Then off he flew,\nBut stopped, and beckoned with a meaning smile,\nWhere the road turned. Pale Rosalind the while,\nHiding her face, stood weeping silently.\n\nIn silence then they took the way\nBeneath the forest's solitude.\nIt was a vast and antique wood,\nThro' which they took their way;\nAnd the gray shades of evening\nO'er that green wilderness did fling\nStill deeper solitude.\nPursuing still the path that wound\nThe vast and knotted trees around\nThrough which slow shades were wandering,\nTo a deep lawny dell they came,\nTo a stone seat beside a spring,\nO'er which the columned wood did frame\nA roofless temple, like the fane\nWhere, ere new creeds could faith obtain,\nMan's early race once knelt beneath\nThe overhanging deity.\nO'er this fair fountain hung the sky,\nNow spangled with rare stars. The snake,\nThe pale snake, that with eager breath\nCreeps here his noontide thirst to slake,\nIs beaming with many a mingled hue,\nShed from yon dome's eternal blue,\nWhen he floats on that dark and lucid flood\nIn the light of his own loveliness;\nAnd the birds that in the fountain dip\nTheir plumes, with fearless fellowship\nAbove and round him wheel and hover.\nThe fitful wind is heard to stir\nOne solitary leaf on high;\nThe chirping of the grasshopper\nFills every pause. There is emotion\nIn all that dwells at noontide here;\nThen, through the intricate wild wood,\nA maze of life and light and motion\nIs woven. But there is stillness now:\nGloom, and the trance of Nature now:\nThe snake is in his cave asleep;\nThe birds are on the branches dreaming:\nOnly the shadows creep:\nOnly the glow-worm is gleaming:\nOnly the owls and the nightingales\nWake in this dell when daylight fails,\nAnd gray shades gather in the woods:\nAnd the owls have all fled far away\nIn a merrier glen to hoot and play,\nFor the moon is veiled and sleeping now.\nThe accustomed nightingale still broods\nOn her accustomed bough,\nBut she is mute; for her false mate\nHas fled and left her desolate.\n\nThis silent spot tradition old\nHad peopled with the spectral dead.\nFor the roots of the speaker's hair felt cold\nAnd stiff, as with tremulous lips he told\nThat a hellish shape at midnight led\nThe ghost of a youth with hoary hair,\nAnd sate on the seat beside him there,\nTill a naked child came wandering by,\nWhen the fiend would change to a lady fair!\nA fearful tale! The truth was worse:\nFor here a sister and a brother\nHad solemnized a monstrous curse,\nMeeting in this fair solitude:\nFor beneath yon very sky,\nHad they resigned to one another\nBody and soul. The multitude:\nTracking them to the secret wood,\nTore limb from limb their innocent child,\nAnd stabbed and trampled on its mother;\nBut the youth, for God's most holy grace,\nA priest saved to burn in the market-place.\n\nDuly at evening Helen came\nTo this lone silent spot,\nFrom the wrecks of a tale of wilder sorrow\nSo much of sympathy to borrow\nAs soothed her own dark lot.\nDuly each evening from her home,\nWith her fair child would Helen come\nTo sit upon that antique seat,\nWhile the hues of day were pale;\nAnd the bright boy beside her feet\nNow lay, lifting at intervals\nHis broad blue eyes on her;\nNow, where some sudden impulse calls\nFollowing. He was a gentle boy\nAnd in all gentle sorts took joy;\nOft in a dry leaf for a boat,\nWith a small feather for a sail,\nHis fancy on that spring would float,\nIf some invisible breeze might stir\nIts marble calm: and Helen smiled\nThrough tears of awe on the gay child,\nTo think that a boy as fair as he,\nIn years which never more may be,\nBy that same fount, in that same wood,\nThe like sweet fancies had pursued;\nAnd that a mother, lost like her,\nHad mournfully sate watching him.\nThen all the scene was wont to swim\nThrough the mist of a burning tear.\n\nFor many months had Helen known\nThis scene; and now she thither turned\nHer footsteps, not alone.\nThe friend whose falsehood she had mourned,\nSate with her on that seat of stone.\nSilent they sate; for evening,\nAnd the power its glimpses bring\nHad, with one awful shadow, quelled\nThe passion of their grief. They sate\nWith linked hands, for unrepelled\nHad Helen taken Rosalind's.\nLike the autumn wind, when it unbinds\nThe tangled locks of the nightshade's hair,\nWhich is twined in the sultry summer air\nRound the walls of an outworn sepulchre,\nDid the voice of Helen, sad and sweet,\nAnd the sound of her heart that ever beat,\nAs with sighs and words she breathed on her,\nUnbind the knots of her friend's despair,\nTill her thoughts were free to float and flow;\nAnd from her labouring bosom now,\nLike the bursting of a prisoned flame,\nThe voice of a long pent sorrow came.\n\nROSALIND:\nI saw the dark earth fall upon\nThe coffin; and I saw the stone\nLaid over him whom this cold breast\nHad pillowed to his nightly rest!\nThou knowest not, thou canst not know\nMy agony. Oh! I could not weep:\nThe sources whence such blessings flow\nWere not to be approached by me!\nBut I could smile, and I could sleep,\nThough with a self-accusing heart.\nIn morning's light, in evening's gloom,\nI watched,--and would not thence depart--\nMy husband's unlamented tomb.\nMy children knew their sire was gone,\nBut when I told them,--'He is dead,'--\nThey laughed aloud in frantic glee,\nThey clapped their hands and leaped about,\nAnswering each other's ecstasy\nWith many a prank and merry shout.\nBut I sate silent and alone,\nWrapped in the mock of mourning weed.\n\nThey laughed, for he was dead: but I\nSate with a hard and tearless eye,\nAnd with a heart which would deny\nThe secret joy it could not quell,\nLow muttering o'er his loathed name;\nTill from that self-contention came\nRemorse where sin was none; a hell\nWhich in pure spirits should not dwell.\n\nI'll tell thee truth. He was a man\nHard, selfish, loving only gold,\nYet full of guile; his pale eyes ran\nWith tears, which each some falsehood told,\nAnd oft his smooth and bridled tongue\nWould give the lie to his flushing cheek;\nHe was a coward to the strong:\nHe was a tyrant to the weak,\nOn whom his vengeance he would wreak:\nFor scorn, whose arrows search the heart,\nFrom many a stranger's eye would dart,\nAnd on his memory cling, and follow\nHis soul to its home so cold and hollow.\nHe was a tyrant to the weak,\nAnd we were such, alas the day!\nOft, when my little ones at play,\nWere in youth's natural lightness gay,\nOr if they listened to some tale\nOf travellers, or of fairy land,--\nWhen the light from the wood-fire's dying brand\nFlashed on their faces,--if they heard\nOr thought they heard upon the stair\nHis footstep, the suspended word\nDied on my lips: we all grew pale:\nThe babe at my bosom was hushed with fear\nIf it thought it heard its father near;\nAnd my two wild boys would near my knee\nCling, cowed and cowering fearfully.\n\nI'll tell thee truth: I loved another.\nHis name in my ear was ever ringing,\nHis form to my brain was ever clinging:\nYet if some stranger breathed that name,\nMy lips turned white, and my heart beat fast:\nMy nights were once haunted by dreams of flame,\nMy days were dim in the shadow cast\nBy the memory of the same!\nDay and night, day and night,\nHe was my breath and life and light,\nFor three short years, which soon were passed.\nOn the fourth, my gentle mother\nLed me to the shrine, to be\nHis sworn bride eternally.\nAnd now we stood on the altar stair,\nWhen my father came from a distant land,\nAnd with a loud and fearful cry\nRushed between us suddenly.\nI saw the stream of his thin gray hair,\nI saw his lean and lifted hand,\nAnd heard his words,--and live! Oh God!\nWherefore do I live?--'Hold, hold!'\nHe cried, 'I tell thee 'tis her brother!\nThy mother, boy, beneath the sod\nOf yon churchyard rests in her shroud so cold:\nI am now weak, and pale, and old:\nWe were once dear to one another,\nI and that corpse! Thou art our child!'\nThen with a laugh both long and wild\nThe youth upon the pavement fell:\nThey found him dead! All looked on me,\nThe spasms of my despair to see:\nBut I was calm. I went away:\nI was clammy-cold like clay!\nI did not weep: I did not speak:\nBut day by day, week after week,\nI walked about like a corpse alive!\nAlas! sweet friend, you must believe\nThis heart is stone: it did not break.\nMy father lived a little while,\nBut all might see that he was dying,\nHe smiled with such a woeful smile!\nWhen he was in the churchyard lying\nAmong the worms, we grew quite poor,\nSo that no one would give us bread:\nMy mother looked at me, and said\nFaint words of cheer, which only meant\nThat she could die and be content;\nSo I went forth from the same church door\nTo another husband's bed.\nAnd this was he who died at last,\nWhen weeks and months and years had passed,\nThrough which I firmly did fulfil\nMy duties, a devoted wife,\nWith the stern step of vanquished will,\nWalking beneath the night of life,\nWhose hours extinguished, like slow rain\nFalling for ever, pain by pain,\nThe very hope of death's dear rest;\nWhich, since the heart within my breast\nOf natural life was dispossessed,\nIts strange sustainer there had been.\n\nWhen flowers were dead, and grass was green\nUpon my mother's grave,--that mother\nWhom to outlive, and cheer, and make\nMy wan eyes glitter for her sake,\nWas my vowed task, the single care\nWhich once gave life to my despair,--\nWhen she was a thing that did not stir\nAnd the crawling worms were cradling her\nTo a sleep more deep and so more sweet\nThan a baby's rocked on its nurse's knee,\nI lived: a living pulse then beat\nBeneath my heart that awakened me.\nWhat was this pulse so warm and free?\nAlas! I knew it could not be\nMy own dull blood: 'twas like a thought\nOf liquid love, that spread and wrought\nUnder my bosom and in my brain,\nAnd crept with the blood through every vein;\nAnd hour by hour, day after day,\nThe wonder could not charm away,\nBut laid in sleep, my wakeful pain,\nUntil I knew it was a child,\nAnd then I wept. For long, long years\nThese frozen eyes had shed no tears:\nBut now--'twas the season fair and mild\nWhen April has wept itself to May:\nI sate through the sweet sunny day\nBy my window bowered round with leaves,\nAnd down my cheeks the quick tears fell\nLike twinkling rain-drops from the eaves,\nWhen warm spring showers are passing o'er.\nO Helen, none can ever tell\nThe joy it was to weep once more!\n\nI wept to think how hard it were\nTo kill my babe, and take from it\nThe sense of light, and the warm air,\nAnd my own fond and tender care,\nAnd love and smiles; ere I knew yet\nThat these for it might, as for me,\nBe the masks of a grinning mockery.\nAnd haply, I would dream, 'twere sweet\nTo feed it from my faded breast,\nOr mark my own heart's restless beat\nRock it to its untroubled rest,\nAnd watch the growing soul beneath\nDawn in faint smiles; and hear its breath,\nHalf interrupted by calm sighs,\nAnd search the depth of its fair eyes\nFor long departed memories!\nAnd so I lived till that sweet load\nWas lightened. Darkly forward flowed\nThe stream of years, and on it bore\nTwo shapes of gladness to my sight;\nTwo other babes, delightful more\nIn my lost soul's abandoned night,\nThan their own country ships may be\nSailing towards wrecked mariners,\nWho cling to the rock of a wintry sea.\nFor each, as it came, brought soothing tears;\nAnd a loosening warmth, as each one lay\nSucking the sullen milk away\nAbout my frozen heart, did play,\nAnd weaned it, oh how painfully--\nAs they themselves were weaned each one\nFrom that sweet food,--even from the thirst\nOf death, and nothingness, and rest,\nStrange inmate of a living breast!\nWhich all that I had undergone\nOf grief and shame, since she, who first\nThe gates of that dark refuge closed,\nCame to my sight, and almost burst\nThe seal of that Lethean spring;\nBut these fair shadows interposed:\nFor all delights are shadows now!\nAnd from my brain to my dull brow\nThe heavy tears gather and flow:\nI cannot speak: Oh, let me weep!\n\nThe tears which fell from her wan eyes\nGlimmered among the moonlight dew:\nHer deep hard sobs and heavy sighs\nTheir echoes in the darkness threw.\nWhen she grew calm, she thus did keep\nThe tenor of her tale:\nHe died:\nI know not how: he was not old,\nIf age be numbered by its years:\nBut he was bowed and bent with fears,\nPale with the quenchless thirst of gold,\nWhich, like fierce fever, left him weak;\nAnd his strait lip and bloated cheek\nWere warped in spasms by hollow sneers;\nAnd selfish cares with barren plough,\nNot age, had lined his narrow brow,\nAnd foul and cruel thoughts, which feed\nUpon the withering life within,\nLike vipers on some poisonous weed.\nWhether his ill were death or sin\nNone knew, until he died indeed,\nAnd then men owned they were the same.\n\nSeven days within my chamber lay\nThat corse, and my babes made holiday:\nAt last, I told them what is death:\nThe eldest, with a kind of shame,\nCame to my knees with silent breath,\nAnd sate awe-stricken at my feet;\nAnd soon the others left their play,\nAnd sate there too. It is unmeet\nTo shed on the brief flower of youth\nThe withering knowledge of the grave;\nFrom me remorse then wrung that truth.\nI could not bear the joy which gave\nToo just a response to mine own.\nIn vain. I dared not feign a groan,\nAnd in their artless looks I saw,\nBetween the mists of fear and awe,\nThat my own thought was theirs, and they\nExpressed it not in words, but said,\nEach in its heart, how every day\nWill pass in happy work and play,\nNow he is dead and gone away.\n\nAfter the funeral all our kin\nAssembled, and the will was read.\nMy friend, I tell thee, even the dead\nHave strength, their putrid shrouds within,\nTo blast and torture. Those who live\nStill fear the living, but a corse\nIs merciless, and power doth give\nTo such pale tyrants half the spoil\nHe rends from those who groan and toil,\nBecause they blush not with remorse\nAmong their crawling worms. Behold,\nI have no child! my tale grows old\nWith grief, and staggers: let it reach\nThe limits of my feeble speech,\nAnd languidly at length recline\nOn the brink of its own grave and mine.\n\nThou knowest what a thing is Poverty\nAmong the fallen on evil days:\n'Tis Crime, and Fear, and Infamy,\nAnd houseless Want in frozen ways\nWandering ungarmented, and Pain,\nAnd, worse than all, that inward stain\nFoul Self-contempt, which drowns in sneers\nYouth's starlight smile, and makes its tears\nFirst like hot gall, then dry for ever!\nAnd well thou knowest a mother never\nCould doom her children to this ill,\nAnd well he knew the same. The will\nImported, that if e'er again\nI sought my children to behold,\nOr in my birthplace did remain\nBeyond three days, whose hours were told,\nThey should inherit nought: and he,\nTo whom next came their patrimony,\nA sallow lawyer, cruel and cold,\nAye watched me, as the will was read,\nWith eyes askance, which sought to see\nThe secrets of my agony;\nAnd with close lips and anxious brow\nStood canvassing still to and fro\nThe chance of my resolve, and all\nThe dead man's caution just did call;\nFor in that killing lie 'twas said--\n'She is adulterous, and doth hold\nIn secret that the Christian creed\nIs false, and therefore is much need\nThat I should have a care to save\nMy children from eternal fire.'\nFriend, he was sheltered by the grave,\nAnd therefore dared to be a liar!\nIn truth, the Indian on the pyre\nOf her dead husband, half consumed,\nAs well might there be false, as I\nTo those abhorred embraces doomed,\nFar worse than fire's brief agony\nAs to the Christian creed, if true\nOr false, I never questioned it:\nI took it as the vulgar do:\nNor my vexed soul had leisure yet\nTo doubt the things men say, or deem\nThat they are other than they seem.\n\nAll present who those crimes did hear,\nIn feigned or actual scorn and fear,\nMen, women, children, slunk away,\nWhispering with self-contented pride,\nWhich half suspects its own base lie.\nI spoke to none, nor did abide,\nBut silently I went my way,\nNor noticed I where joyously\nSate my two younger babes at play,\nIn the court-yard through which I passed;\nBut went with footsteps firm and fast\nTill I came to the brink of the ocean green,\nAnd there, a woman with gray hairs,\nWho had my mother's servant been,\nKneeling, with many tears and prayers,\nMade me accept a purse of gold,\nHalf of the earnings she had kept\nTo refuge her when weak and old.\n\nWith woe, which never sleeps or slept,\nI wander now. 'Tis a vain thought--\nBut on yon alp, whose snowy head\n'Mid the azure air is islanded,\n(We see it o'er the flood of cloud,\nWhich sunrise from its eastern caves\nDrives, wrinkling into golden waves,\nHung with its precipices proud,\nFrom that gray stone where first we met)\nThere now--who knows the dead feel nought?--\nShould be my grave; for he who yet\nIs my soul's soul, once said: ''Twere sweet\n'Mid stars and lightnings to abide,\nAnd winds and lulling snows, that beat\nWith their soft flakes the mountain wide,\nWhere weary meteor lamps repose,\nAnd languid storms their pinions close:\nAnd all things strong and bright and pure,\nAnd ever during, aye endure:\nWho knows, if one were buried there,\nBut these things might our spirits make,\nAmid the all-surrounding air,\nTheir own eternity partake?'\nThen 'twas a wild and playful saying\nAt which I laughed, or seemed to laugh:\nThey were his words: now heed my praying,\nAnd let them be my epitaph.\nThy memory for a term may be\nMy monument. Wilt remember me?\nI know thou wilt, and canst forgive\nWhilst in this erring world to live\nMy soul disdained not, that I thought\nIts lying forms were worthy aught\nAnd much less thee.\n\nHELEN:\nO speak not so,\nBut come to me and pour thy woe\nInto this heart, full though it be,\nAy, overflowing with its own:\nI thought that grief had severed me\nFrom all beside who weep and groan;\nIts likeness upon earth to be,\nIts express image; but thou art\nMore wretched. Sweet! we will not part\nHenceforth, if death be not division;\nIf so, the dead feel no contrition.\nBut wilt thou hear since last we parted\nAll that has left me broken hearted?\n\nROSALIND:\nYes, speak. The faintest stars are scarcely shorn\nOf their thin beams by that delusive morn\nWhich sinks again in darkness, like the light\nOf early love, soon lost in total night.\n\nHELEN:\nAlas! Italian winds are mild,\nBut my bosom is cold--wintry cold--\nWhen the warm air weaves, among the fresh leaves,\nSoft music, my poor brain is wild,\nAnd I am weak like a nursling child,\nThough my soul with grief is gray and old.\n\nROSALIND:\nWeep not at thine own words, though they must make\nMe weep. What is thy tale?\n\nHELEN:\nI fear 'twill shake\nThy gentle heart with tears. Thou well\nRememberest when we met no more,\nAnd, though I dwelt with Lionel,\nThat friendless caution pierced me sore\nWith grief; a wound my spirit bore\nIndignantly, but when he died,\nWith him lay dead both hope and pride.\nAlas! all hope is buried now.\nBut then men dreamed the aged earth\nWas labouring in that mighty birth,\nWhich many a poet and a sage\nHas aye foreseen--the happy age\nWhen truth and love shall dwell below\nAmong the works and ways of men;\nWhich on this world not power but will\nEven now is wanting to fulfil.\n\nAmong mankind what thence befell\nOf strife, how vain, is known too well;\nWhen Liberty's dear paean fell\n'Mid murderous howls. To Lionel,\nThough of great wealth and lineage high,\nYet through those dungeon walls there came\nThy thrilling light, O Liberty!\nAnd as the meteor's midnight flame\nStartles the dreamer, sun-like truth\nFlashed on his visionary youth,\nAnd filled him, not with love, but faith,\nAnd hope, and courage mute in death;\nFor love and life in him were twins,\nBorn at one birth: in every other\nFirst life then love its course begins,\nThough they be children of one mother;\nAnd so through this dark world they fleet\nDivided, till in death they meet;\nBut he loved all things ever. Then\nHe passed amid the strife of men,\nAnd stood at the throne of armed power\nPleading for a world of woe:\nSecure as one on a rock-built tower\nO'er the wrecks which the surge trails to and fro,\n'Mid the passions wild of human kind\nHe stood, like a spirit calming them;\nFor, it was said, his words could bind\nLike music the lulled crowd, and stem\nThat torrent of unquiet dream\nWhich mortals truth and reason deem,\nBut is revenge and fear and pride.\nJoyous he was; and hope and peace\nOn all who heard him did abide,\nRaining like dew from his sweet talk,\nAs where the evening star may walk\nAlong the brink of the gloomy seas,\nLiquid mists of splendour quiver.\nHis very gestures touched to tears\nThe unpersuaded tyrant, never\nSo moved before: his presence stung\nThe torturers with their victim's pain,\nAnd none knew how; and through their ears\nThe subtle witchcraft of his tongue\nUnlocked the hearts of those who keep\nGold, the world's bond of slavery.\nMen wondered, and some sneered to see\nOne sow what he could never reap:\nFor he is rich, they said, and young,\nAnd might drink from the depths of luxury.\nIf he seeks Fame, Fame never crowned\nThe champion of a trampled creed:\nIf he seeks Power, Power is enthroned\n'Mid ancient rights and wrongs, to feed\nWhich hungry wolves with praise and spoil,\nThose who would sit near Power must toil;\nAnd such, there sitting, all may see.\nWhat seeks he? All that others seek\nHe casts away, like a vile weed\nWhich the sea casts unreturningly.\nThat poor and hungry men should break\nThe laws which wreak them toil and scorn,\nWe understand; but Lionel\nWe know, is rich and nobly born.\nSo wondered they: yet all men loved\nYoung Lionel, though few approved;\nAll but the priests, whose hatred fell\nLike the unseen blight of a smiling day,\nThe withering honey dew, which clings\nUnder the bright green buds of May,\nWhilst they unfold their emerald wings:\nFor he made verses wild and queer\nOn the strange creeds priests hold so dear,\nBecause they bring them land and gold.\nOf devils and saints and all such gear,\nHe made tales which whoso heard or read\nWould laugh till he were almost dead.\nSo this grew a proverb: 'Don't get old\nTill Lionel's \"Banquet in Hell\" you hear,\nAnd then you will laugh yourself young again.'\nSo the priests hated him, and he\nRepaid their hate with cheerful glee.\n\nAh, smiles and joyance quickly died,\nFor public hope grew pale and dim\nIn an altered time and tide,\nAnd in its wasting withered him,\nAs a summer flower that blows too soon\nDroops in the smile of the waning moon,\nWhen it scatters through an April night\nThe frozen dews of wrinkling blight.\nNone now hoped more. Gray Power was seated\nSafely on her ancestral throne;\nAnd Faith, the Python, undefeated,\nEven to its blood-stained steps dragged on\nHer foul and wounded train, and men\nWere trampled and deceived again,\nAnd words and shows again could bind\nThe wailing tribes of human kind\nIn scorn and famine. Fire and blood\nRaged round the raging multitude,\nTo fields remote by tyrants sent\nTo be the scorned instrument\nWith which they drag from mines of gore\nThe chains their slaves yet ever wore:\nAnd in the streets men met each other,\nAnd by old altars and in halls,\nAnd smiled again at festivals.\nBut each man found in his heart's brother\nCold cheer; for all, though half deceived,\nThe outworn creeds again believed,\nAnd the same round anew began,\nWhich the weary world yet ever ran.\n\nMany then wept, not tears, but gall\nWithin their hearts, like drops which fall\nWasting the fountain-stone away.\nAnd in that dark and evil day\nDid all desires and thoughts, that claim\nMen's care--ambition, friendship, fame,\nLove, hope, though hope was now despair--\nIndue the colours of this change,\nAs from the all-surrounding air\nThe earth takes hues obscure and strange,\nWhen storm and earthquake linger there.\n\nAnd so, my friend, it then befell\nTo many, most to Lionel,\nWhose hope was like the life of youth\nWithin him, and when dead, became\nA spirit of unresting flame,\nWhich goaded him in his distress\nOver the world's vast wilderness.\nThree years he left his native land,\nAnd on the fourth, when he returned,\nNone knew him: he was stricken deep\nWith some disease of mind, and turned\nInto aught unlike Lionel.\nOn him, on whom, did he pause in sleep,\nSerenest smiles were wont to keep,\nAnd, did he wake, a winged band\nOf bright persuasions, which had fed\nOn his sweet lips and liquid eyes,\nKept their swift pinions half outspread\nTo do on men his least command;\nOn him, whom once 'twas paradise\nEven to behold, now misery lay:\nIn his own heart 'twas merciless,\nTo all things else none may express\nIts innocence and tenderness.\n\n'Twas said that he had refuge sought\nIn love from his unquiet thought\nIn distant lands, and been deceived\nBy some strange show; for there were found,\nBlotted with tears as those relieved\nBy their own words are wont to do,\nThese mournful verses on the ground,\nBy all who read them blotted too.\n\n'How am I changed! my hopes were once like fire:\nI loved, and I believed that life was love.\nHow am I lost! on wings of swift desire\nAmong Heaven's winds my spirit once did move.\nI slept, and silver dreams did aye inspire\nMy liquid sleep: I woke, and did approve\nAll nature to my heart, and thought to make\nA paradise of earth for one sweet sake.\n\n'I love, but I believe in love no more.\nI feel desire, but hope not. O, from sleep\nMost vainly must my weary brain implore\nIts long lost flattery now: I wake to weep,\nAnd sit through the long day gnawing the core\nOf my bitter heart, and, like a miser, keep,\nSince none in what I feel take pain or pleasure,\nTo my own soul its self-consuming treasure.'\n\nHe dwelt beside me near the sea;\nAnd oft in evening did we meet,\nWhen the waves, beneath the starlight, flee\nO'er the yellow sands with silver feet,\nAnd talked: our talk was sad and sweet,\nTill slowly from his mien there passed\nThe desolation which it spoke;\nAnd smiles,--as when the lightning's blast\nHas parched some heaven-delighting oak,\nThe next spring shows leaves pale and rare,\nBut like flowers delicate and fair,\nOn its rent boughs,--again arrayed\nHis countenance in tender light:\nHis words grew subtile fire, which made\nThe air his hearers breathed delight:\nHis motions, like the winds, were free,\nWhich bend the bright grass gracefully,\nThen fade away in circlets faint:\nAnd winged Hope, on which upborne\nHis soul seemed hovering in his eyes,\nLike some bright spirit newly born\nFloating amid the sunny skies,\nSprang forth from his rent heart anew.\nYet o'er his talk, and looks, and mien,\nTempering their loveliness too keen,\nPast woe its shadow backward threw,\nTill like an exhalation, spread\nFrom flowers half drunk with evening dew,\nThey did become infectious: sweet\nAnd subtle mists of sense and thought:\nWhich wrapped us soon, when we might meet,\nAlmost from our own looks and aught\nThe wild world holds. And so, his mind\nWas healed, while mine grew sick with fear:\nFor ever now his health declined,\nLike some frail bark which cannot bear\nThe impulse of an altered wind,\nThough prosperous: and my heart grew full\n'Mid its new joy of a new care:\nFor his cheek became, not pale, but fair,\nAs rose-o'ershadowed lilies are;\nAnd soon his deep and sunny hair,\nIn this alone less beautiful,\nLike grass in tombs grew wild and rare.\nThe blood in his translucent veins\nBeat, not like animal life, but love\nSeemed now its sullen springs to move,\nWhen life had failed, and all its pains:\nAnd sudden sleep would seize him oft\nLike death, so calm, but that a tear,\nHis pointed eyelashes between,\nWould gather in the light serene\nOf smiles, whose lustre bright and soft\nBeneath lay undulating there.\nHis breath was like inconstant flame,\nAs eagerly it went and came;\nAnd I hung o'er him in his sleep,\nTill, like an image in the lake\nWhich rains disturb, my tears would break\nThe shadow of that slumber deep:\nThen he would bid me not to weep,\nAnd say, with flattery false, yet sweet,\nThat death and he could never meet,\nIf I would never part with him.\nAnd so we loved, and did unite\nAll that in us was yet divided:\nFor when he said, that many a rite,\nBy men to bind but once provided,\nCould not be shared by him and me,\nOr they would kill him in their glee,\nI shuddered, and then laughing said--\n'We will have rites our faith to bind,\nBut our church shall be the starry night,\nOur altar the grassy earth outspread,\nAnd our priest the muttering wind.'\n\n'Twas sunset as I spoke: one star\nHad scarce burst forth, when from afar\nThe ministers of misrule sent,\nSeized upon Lionel, and bore\nHis chained limbs to a dreary tower,\nIn the midst of a city vast and wide.\nFor he, they said, from his mind had bent\nAgainst their gods keen blasphemy,\nFor which, though his soul must roasted be\nIn hell's red lakes immortally,\nYet even on earth must he abide\nThe vengeance of their slaves: a trial,\nI think, men call it. What avail\nAre prayers and tears, which chase denial\nFrom the fierce savage, nursed in hate?\nWhat the knit soul that pleading and pale\nMakes wan the quivering cheek, which late\nIt painted with its own delight?\nWe were divided. As I could,\nI stilled the tingling of my blood,\nAnd followed him in their despite,\nAs a widow follows, pale and wild,\nThe murderers and corse of her only child;\nAnd when we came to the prison door\nAnd I prayed to share his dungeon floor\nWith prayers which rarely have been spurned,\nAnd when men drove me forth and I\nStared with blank frenzy on the sky,\nA farewell look of love he turned,\nHalf calming me; then gazed awhile,\nAs if thro' that black and massy pile,\nAnd thro' the crowd around him there,\nAnd thro' the dense and murky air,\nAnd the thronged streets, he did espy\nWhat poets know and prophesy;\nAnd said, with voice that made them shiver\nAnd clung like music in my brain,\nAnd which the mute walls spoke again\nProlonging it with deepened strain:\n'Fear not the tyrants shall rule for ever,\nOr the priests of the bloody faith;\nThey stand on the brink of that mighty river,\nWhose waves they have tainted with death:\nIt is fed from the depths of a thousand dells,\nAround them it foams, and rages, and swells,\nAnd their swords and their sceptres I floating see,\nLike wrecks in the surge of eternity.'\n\nI dwelt beside the prison gate;\nAnd the strange crowd that out and in\nPassed, some, no doubt, with mine own fate,\nMight have fretted me with its ceaseless din,\nBut the fever of care was louder within.\nSoon, but too late, in penitence\nOr fear, his foes released him thence:\nI saw his thin and languid form,\nAs leaning on the jailor's arm,\nWhose hardened eyes grew moist the while,\nTo meet his mute and faded smile,\nAnd hear his words of kind farewell,\nHe tottered forth from his damp cell.\nMany had never wept before,\nFrom whom fast tears then gushed and fell:\nMany will relent no more,\nWho sobbed like infants then; aye, all\nWho thronged the prison's stony hall,\nThe rulers or the slaves of law,\nFelt with a new surprise and awe\nThat they were human, till strong shame\nMade them again become the same.\nThe prison blood-hounds, huge and grim,\nFrom human looks the infection caught,\nAnd fondly crouched and fawned on him;\nAnd men have heard the prisoners say,\nWho in their rotting dungeons lay,\nThat from that hour, throughout one day,\nThe fierce despair and hate which kept\nTheir trampled bosoms almost slept:\nWhere, like twin vultures, they hung feeding\nOn each heart's wound, wide torn and bleeding,--\nBecause their jailors' rule, they thought,\nGrew merciful, like a parent's sway.\n\nI know not how, but we were free:\nAnd Lionel sate alone with me,\nAs the carriage drove thro' the streets apace;\nAnd we looked upon each other's face;\nAnd the blood in our fingers intertwined\nRan like the thoughts of a single mind,\nAs the swift emotions went and came\nThro' the veins of each united frame.\nSo thro' the long long streets we passed\nOf the million-peopled City vast;\nWhich is that desert, where each one\nSeeks his mate yet is alone,\nBeloved and sought and mourned of none;\nUntil the clear blue sky was seen,\nAnd the grassy meadows bright and green,\nAnd then I sunk in his embrace,\nEnclosing there a mighty space\nOf love: and so we travelled on\nBy woods, and fields of yellow flowers,\nAnd towns, and villages, and towers,\nDay after day of happy hours.\nIt was the azure time of June,\nWhen the skies are deep in the stainless noon,\nAnd the warm and fitful breezes shake\nThe fresh green leaves of the hedgerow briar,\nAnd there were odours then to make\nThe very breath we did respire\nA liquid element, whereon\nOur spirits, like delighted things\nThat walk the air on subtle wings,\nFloated and mingled far away,\n'Mid the warm winds of the sunny day.\nAnd when the evening star came forth\nAbove the curve of the new bent moon,\nAnd light and sound ebbed from the earth,\nLike the tide of the full and the weary sea\nTo the depths of its own tranquillity,\nOur natures to its own repose\nDid the earth's breathless sleep attune:\nLike flowers, which on each other close\nTheir languid leaves when daylight's gone,\nWe lay, till new emotions came,\nWhich seemed to make each mortal frame\nOne soul of interwoven flame,\nA life in life, a second birth\nIn worlds diviner far than earth,\nWhich, like two strains of harmony\nThat mingle in the silent sky\nThen slowly disunite, passed by\nAnd left the tenderness of tears,\nA soft oblivion of all fears,\nA sweet sleep: so we travelled on\nTill we came to the home of Lionel,\nAmong the mountains wild and lone,\nBeside the hoary western sea,\nWhich near the verge of the echoing shore\nThe massy forest shadowed o'er.\n\nThe ancient steward, with hair all hoar,\nAs we alighted, wept to see\nHis master changed so fearfully;\nAnd the old man's sobs did waken me\nFrom my dream of unremaining gladness;\nThe truth flashed o'er me like quick madness\nWhen I looked, and saw that there was death\nOn Lionel: yet day by day\nHe lived, till fear grew hope and faith,\nAnd in my soul I dared to say,\nNothing so bright can pass away:\nDeath is dark, and foul, and dull,\nBut he is--O how beautiful!\nYet day by day he grew more weak,\nAnd his sweet voice, when he might speak,\nWhich ne'er was loud, became more low;\nAnd the light which flashed through his waxen cheek\nGrew faint, as the rose-like hues which flow\nFrom sunset o'er the Alpine snow:\nAnd death seemed not like death in him,\nFor the spirit of life o'er every limb\nLingered, a mist of sense and thought.\nWhen the summer wind faint odours brought\nFrom mountain flowers, even as it passed\nHis cheek would change, as the noonday sea\nWhich the dying breeze sweeps fitfully.\nIf but a cloud the sky o'ercast,\nYou might see his colour come and go,\nAnd the softest strain of music made\nSweet smiles, yet sad, arise and fade\nAmid the dew of his tender eyes;\nAnd the breath, with intermitting flow,\nMade his pale lips quiver and part.\nYou might hear the beatings of his heart,\nQuick, but not strong; and with my tresses\nWhen oft he playfully would bind\nIn the bowers of mossy lonelinesses\nHis neck, and win me so to mingle\nIn the sweet depth of woven caresses,\nAnd our faint limbs were intertwined,\nAlas! the unquiet life did tingle\nFrom mine own heart through every vein,\nLike a captive in dreams of liberty,\nWho beats the walls of his stony cell.\nBut his, it seemed already free,\nLike the shadow of fire surrounding me!\nOn my faint eyes and limbs did dwell\nThat spirit as it passed, till soon,\nAs a frail cloud wandering o'er the moon,\nBeneath its light invisible,\nIs seen when it folds its gray wings again\nTo alight on midnight's dusky plain,\nI lived and saw, and the gathering soul\nPassed from beneath that strong control,\nAnd I fell on a life which was sick with fear\nOf all the woe that now I bear.\n\nAmid a bloomless myrtle wood,\nOn a green and sea-girt promontory,\nNot far from where we dwelt, there stood\nIn record of a sweet sad story,\nAn altar and a temple bright\nCircled by steps, and o'er the gate\nWas sculptured, 'To Fidelity;'\nAnd in the shrine an image sate,\nAll veiled: but there was seen the light\nOf smiles which faintly could express\nA mingled pain and tenderness\nThrough that ethereal drapery.\nThe left hand held the head, the right--\nBeyond the veil, beneath the skin,\nYou might see the nerves quivering within--\nWas forcing the point of a barbed dart\nInto its side-convulsing heart.\nAn unskilled hand, yet one informed\nWith genius, had the marble warmed\nWith that pathetic life. This tale\nIt told: A dog had from the sea,\nWhen the tide was raging fearfully,\nDragged Lionel's mother, weak and pale,\nThen died beside her on the sand,\nAnd she that temple thence had planned;\nBut it was Lionel's own hand\nHad wrought the image. Each new moon\nThat lady did, in this lone fane,\nThe rites of a religion sweet,\nWhose god was in her heart and brain:\nThe seasons' loveliest flowers were strewn\nOn the marble floor beneath her feet,\nAnd she brought crowns of sea-buds white\nWhose odour is so sweet and faint,\nAnd weeds, like branching chrysolite,\nWoven in devices fine and quaint.\nAnd tears from her brown eyes did stain\nThe altar: need but look upon\nThat dying statue fair and wan,\nIf tears should cease, to weep again:\nAnd rare Arabian odours came,\nThrough the myrtle copses steaming thence\nFrom the hissing frankincense,\nWhose smoke, wool-white as ocean foam,\nHung in dense flocks beneath the dome--\nThat ivory dome, whose azure night\nWith golden stars, like heaven, was bright--\nO'er the split cedar's pointed flame;\nAnd the lady's harp would kindle there\nThe melody of an old air,\nSofter than sleep; the villagers\nMixed their religion up with hers,\nAnd, as they listened round, shed tears.\n\nOne eve he led me to this fane:\nDaylight on its last purple cloud\nWas lingering gray, and soon her strain\nThe nightingale began; now loud,\nClimbing in circles the windless sky,\nNow dying music; suddenly\n'Tis scattered in a thousand notes,\nAnd now to the hushed ear it floats\nLike field smells known in infancy,\nThen failing, soothes the air again.\nWe sate within that temple lone,\nPavilioned round with Parian stone:\nHis mother's harp stood near, and oft\nI had awakened music soft\nAmid its wires: the nightingale\nWas pausing in her heaven-taught tale:\n'Now drain the cup,' said Lionel,\n'Which the poet-bird has crowned so well\nWith the wine of her bright and liquid song!\nHeardst thou not sweet words among\nThat heaven-resounding minstrelsy?\nHeard'st thou not that those who die\nAwake in a world of ecstasy?\nThat love, when limbs are interwoven,\nAnd sleep, when the night of life is cloven,\nAnd thought, to the world's dim boundaries clinging,\nAnd music, when one beloved is singing,\nIs death? Let us drain right joyously\nThe cup which the sweet bird fills for me.'\nHe paused, and to my lips he bent\nHis own: like spirit his words went\nThrough all my limbs with the speed of fire;\nAnd his keen eyes, glittering through mine,\nFilled me with the flame divine,\nWhich in their orbs was burning far,\nLike the light of an unmeasured star,\nIn the sky of midnight dark and deep:\nYes, 'twas his soul that did inspire\nSounds, which my skill could ne'er awaken;\nAnd first, I felt my fingers sweep\nThe harp, and a long quivering cry\nBurst from my lips in symphony:\nThe dusk and solid air was shaken,\nAs swift and swifter the notes came\nFrom my touch, that wandered like quick flame,\nAnd from my bosom, labouring\nWith some unutterable thing:\nThe awful sound of my own voice made\nMy faint lips tremble; in some mood\nOf wordless thought Lionel stood\nSo pale, that even beside his cheek\nThe snowy column from its shade\nCaught whiteness: yet his countenance,\nRaised upward, burned with radiance\nOf spirit-piercing joy, whose light,\nLike the moon struggling through the night\nOf whirlwind-rifted clouds, did break\nWith beams that might not be confined.\nI paused, but soon his gestures kindled\nNew power, as by the moving wind\nThe waves are lifted, and my song\nTo low soft notes now changed and dwindled,\nAnd from the twinkling wires among,\nMy languid fingers drew and flung\nCircles of life-dissolving sound,\nYet faint; in aery rings they bound\nMy Lionel, who, as every strain\nGrew fainter but more sweet, his mien\nSunk with the sound relaxedly;\nAnd slowly now he turned to me,\nAs slowly faded from his face\nThat awful joy: with looks serene\nHe was soon drawn to my embrace,\nAnd my wild song then died away\nIn murmurs: words I dare not say\nWe mixed, and on his lips mine fed\nTill they methought felt still and cold:\n'What is it with thee, love?' I said:\nNo word, no look, no motion! yes,\nThere was a change, but spare to guess,\nNor let that moment's hope be told.\nI looked, and knew that he was dead,\nAnd fell, as the eagle on the plain\nFalls when life deserts her brain,\nAnd the mortal lightning is veiled again.\n\nO that I were now dead! but such\n(Did they not, love, demand too much,\nThose dying murmurs?) he forbade.\nO that I once again were mad!\nAnd yet, dear Rosalind, not so,\nFor I would live to share thy woe.\nSweet boy! did I forget thee too?\nAlas, we know not what we do\nWhen we speak words.\nNo memory more\nIs in my mind of that sea shore.\nMadness came on me, and a troop\nOf misty shapes did seem to sit\nBeside me, on a vessel's poop,\nAnd the clear north wind was driving it.\nThen I heard strange tongues, and saw strange flowers,\nAnd the stars methought grew unlike ours,\nAnd the azure sky and the stormless sea\nMade me believe that I had died,\nAnd waked in a world, which was to me\nDrear hell, though heaven to all beside:\nThen a dead sleep fell on my mind,\nWhilst animal life many long years\nHad rescued from a chasm of tears;\nAnd when I woke, I wept to find\nThat the same lady, bright and wise,\nWith silver locks and quick brown eyes,\nThe mother of my Lionel,\nHad tended me in my distress,\nAnd died some months before. Nor less\nWonder, but far more peace and joy,\nBrought in that hour my lovely boy;\nFor through that trance my soul had well\nThe impress of thy being kept;\nAnd if I waked, or if I slept,\nNo doubt, though memory faithless be,\nThy image ever dwelt on me;\nAnd thus, O Lionel, like thee\nIs our sweet child. 'Tis sure most strange\nI knew not of so great a change,\nAs that which gave him birth, who now\nIs all the solace of my woe.\n\nThat Lionel great wealth had left\nBy will to me, and that of all\nThe ready lies of law bereft\nMy child and me, might well befall.\nBut let me think not of the scorn,\nWhich from the meanest I have borne,\nWhen, for my child's beloved sake,\nI mixed with slaves, to vindicate\nThe very laws themselves do make:\nLet me not say scorn is my fate,\nLest I be proud, suffering the same\nWith those who live in deathless fame.\n\nShe ceased.--'Lo, where red morning thro' the woods\nIs burning o'er the dew;' said Rosalind.\nAnd with these words they rose, and towards the flood\nOf the blue lake, beneath the leaves now wind\nWith equal steps and fingers intertwined:\nThence to a lonely dwelling, where the shore\nIs shadowed with steep rocks, and cypresses\nCleave with their dark green cones the silent skies,\nAnd with their shadows the clear depths below,\nAnd where a little terrace from its bowers,\nOf blooming myrtle and faint lemon-flowers,\nScatters its sense-dissolving fragrance o'er\nThe liquid marble of the windless lake;\nAnd where the aged forest's limbs look hoar,\nUnder the leaves which their green garments make,\nThey come: 'Tis Helen's home, and clean and white,\nLike one which tyrants spare on our own land\nIn some such solitude, its casements bright\nShone through their vine-leaves in the morning sun,\nAnd even within 'twas scarce like Italy.\nAnd when she saw how all things there were planned,\nAs in an English home, dim memory\nDisturbed poor Rosalind: she stood as one\nWhose mind is where his body cannot be,\nTill Helen led her where her child yet slept,\nAnd said, 'Observe, that brow was Lionel's,\nThose lips were his, and so he ever kept\nOne arm in sleep, pillowing his head with it.\nYou cannot see his eyes--they are two wells\nOf liquid love: let us not wake him yet.'\nBut Rosalind could bear no more, and wept\nA shower of burning tears, which fell upon\nHis face, and so his opening lashes shone\nWith tears unlike his own, as he did leap\nIn sudden wonder from his innocent sleep.\n\nSo Rosalind and Helen lived together\nThenceforth, changed in all else, yet friends again,\nSuch as they were, when o'er the mountain heather\nThey wandered in their youth, through sun and rain.\nAnd after many years, for human things\nChange even like the ocean and the wind,\nHer daughter was restored to Rosalind,\nAnd in their circle thence some visitings\nOf joy 'mid their new calm would intervene:\nA lovely child she was, of looks serene,\nAnd motions which o'er things indifferent shed\nThe grace and gentleness from whence they came.\nAnd Helen's boy grew with her, and they fed\nFrom the same flowers of thought, until each mind\nLike springs which mingle in one flood became,\nAnd in their union soon their parents saw\nThe shadow of the peace denied to them.\nAnd Rosalind, for when the living stem\nIs cankered in its heart, the tree must fall,\nDied ere her time; and with deep grief and awe\nThe pale survivors followed her remains\nBeyond the region of dissolving rains,\nUp the cold mountain she was wont to call\nHer tomb; and on Chiavenna's precipice\nThey raised a pyramid of lasting ice,\nWhose polished sides, ere day had yet begun,\nCaught the first glow of the unrisen sun,\nThe last, when it had sunk; and thro' the night\nThe charioteers of Arctos wheeled round\nIts glittering point, as seen from Helen's home,\nWhose sad inhabitants each year would come,\nWith willing steps climbing that rugged height,\nAnd hang long locks of hair, and garlands bound\nWith amaranth flowers, which, in the clime's despite,\nFilled the frore air with unaccustomed light:\nSuch flowers, as in the wintry memory bloom\nOf one friend left, adorned that frozen tomb.\n\nHelen, whose spirit was of softer mould,\nWhose sufferings too were less, Death slowlier led\nInto the peace of his dominion cold:\nShe died among her kindred, being old.\nAnd know, that if love die not in the dead\nAs in the living, none of mortal kind\nAre blest, as now Helen and Rosalind.","title":"Rosalind

way--\nHe had a mask like Castlereagh--\nVery smooth he looked, yet grim;\nSeven blood-hounds followed him:\n\nAll were fat; and well they might\nBe in admirable plight,\nFor one by one, and two by two,\nHe tossed them human hearts to chew\nWhich from his wide cloak he drew.\n\nNext came Fraud, and he had on,\nLike Eldon, an ermined gown;\nHis big tears, for he wept well,\nTurned to mill-stones as they fell.\n\nAnd the little children, who\nRound his feet played to and fro,\nThinking every tear a gem,\nHad their brains knocked out by them.\n\nClothed with the Bible, as with light,\nAnd the shadows of the night,\nLike Sidmouth, next, Hypocrisy\nOn a crocodile rode by.\n\nAnd many more Destructions played\nIn this ghastly masquerade,\nAll disguised, even to the eyes,\nLike Bishops, lawyers, peers, or spies.\n\nLast came Anarchy: he rode\nOn a white horse, splashed with blood;\nHe was pale even to the lips,\nLike Death in the Apocalypse.\n\nAnd he wore a kingly crown;\nAnd in his

well as if his education\nHad cost ten millions to the nation.\n\nFor he knew the Palaces\nOf our Kings were rightly his;\nHis the sceptre, crown, and globe,\nAnd the gold-inwoven robe.\n\nSo he sent his slaves before\nTo seize upon the Bank and Tower,\nAnd was proceeding with intent\nTo meet his pensioned Parliament\n\nWhen one fled past, a maniac maid,\nAnd her name was Hope, she said:\nBut she looked more like Despair,\nAnd she cried out in the air:\n\n'My father Time is weak and gray\nWith waiting for a better day;\nSee how idiot-like he stands,\nFumbling with his palsied hands!\n\n'He has had child after child,\nAnd the dust of death is piled\nOver every one but me--\nMisery, oh, Misery!'\n\nThen she lay down in the street,\nRight before the horses' feet,\nExpecting, with a patient eye,\nMurder, Fraud, and Anarchy.\n\nWhen between her and her foes\nA mist, a light, an image rose,\nSmall at first, and weak, and frail\nLike the vapour of a vale:\n\nTill as clouds grow on the blast,\nLike tower-crowned giants striding fast,\nAnd glare with lightnings as they fly,\nAnd speak in thunder to the sky,\n\nIt grew--a Shape arrayed in mail\nBrighter than the viper's scale,\nAnd upborne on wings whose grain\nWas as the light of sunny rain.\n\nOn its helm, seen far away,\nA planet, like the Morning's, lay;\nAnd those plumes its light rained through\nLike a shower of crimson dew.\n\nWith step as soft as wind it passed\nO'er the heads of men--so fast\nThat they knew the presence there,\nAnd looked,--but all was empty air.\n\nAs flowers beneath May's footstep waken,\nAs stars from Night's loose hair are shaken,\nAs waves arise when loud winds call,\nThoughts sprung where'er that step did fall.\n\nAnd the prostrate multitude\nLooked--and ankle-deep in blood,\nHope, that maiden most serene,\nWas walking with a quiet mien:\n\nAnd Anarchy, the ghastly birth,\nLay dead earth upon the earth;\nThe Horse of Death tameless as wind\nFled, and with his hoofs did grind\nTo dust the murderers thronged behind.\n\nA rushing light of clouds and splendour,\nA sense awakening and yet tender\nWas heard and felt--and at its close\nThese words of joy and fear arose\n\nAs if their own indignant Earth\nWhich gave the sons of England birth\nHad felt their blood upon her brow,\nAnd shuddering with a mother's throe\n\nHad turned every drop of blood\nBy which her face had been bedewed\nTo an accent unwithstood,--\nAs if her heart had cried aloud:\n\n'Men of England, heirs of Glory,\nHeroes of unwritten story,\nNurslings of one mighty Mother,\nHopes of her, and one another;\n\n'Rise like Lions after slumber\nIn unvanquishable number,\nShake your chains to earth like dew\nWhich in sleep had fallen on you--\nYe are many--they are few.\n\n'What is Freedom?--ye can tell\nThat which slavery is, too well--\nFor its very name has grown\nTo an echo of your own.\n\n''Tis to work and have such pay\nAs just keeps life from day to day\nIn your limbs, as in a cell\nFor the tyrants' use to dwell,\n\n'So that ye for them are made\nLoom, and plough, and sword, and spade,\nWith or without your own will bent\nTo their defence and nourishment.\n\n''Tis to see your children weak\nWith their mothers pine and peak,\nWhen the winter winds are bleak,--\nThey are dying whilst I speak.\n\n''Tis to hunger for such diet\nAs the rich man in his riot\nCasts to the fat dogs that lie\nSurfeiting beneath his eye;\n\n''Tis to let the Ghost of Gold\nTake from Toil a thousandfold\nMore than e'er its substance could\nIn the tyrannies of old.\n\n'Paper coin--that forgery\nOf the title-deeds, which ye\nHold to something of the worth\nOf the inheritance of Earth.\n\n''Tis to be a slave in soul\nAnd to hold no strong control\nOver your own wills, but be\nAll that others make of ye.\n\n'And at length when ye complain\nWith a murmur weak and vain\n'Tis to see the Tyrant's crew\nRide over your wives and you\nBlood is on the grass like dew.\n\n'Then it is to feel revenge\nFiercely thirsting to exchange\nBlood for blood--and wrong for wrong--\nDo not thus when ye are strong.\n\n'Birds find rest, in narrow nest\nWhen weary of their winged quest;\nBeasts find fare, in woody lair\nWhen storm and snow are in the air.\n\n'Asses, swine, have litter spread\nAnd with fitting food are fed;\nAll things have a home but one--\nThou, Oh, Englishman, hast none!\n\n'This is Slavery--savage men,\nOr wild beasts within a den\nWould endure not as ye do--\nBut such ills they never knew.\n\n'What art thou Freedom? O! could slaves\nAnswer from their living graves\nThis demand--tyrants would flee\nLike a dream's dim imagery:\n\n'Thou art not, as impostors say,\nA shadow soon to pass away,\nA superstition, and a name\nEchoing from the cave of Fame.\n\n'For the labourer thou art bread,\nAnd a comely table spread\nFrom his daily labour come\nIn a neat and happy home.\n\nThou art clothes, and fire, and food\nFor the trampled multitude--\nNo--in countries that are free\nSuch starvation cannot be\nAs in England now we see.\n\n'To the rich thou art a check,\nWhen his foot is on the neck\nOf his victim, thou dost make\nThat he treads upon a snake.\n\nThou art Justice--ne'er for gold\nMay thy righteous laws be sold\nAs laws are in England--thou\nShield'st alike the high and low.\n\n'Thou art Wisdom--Freemen never\nDream that God will damn for ever\nAll who think those things untrue\nOf which Priests make such ado.\n\n'Thou art Peace--never by thee\nWould blood and treasure wasted be\nAs tyrants wasted them, when all\nLeagued to quench thy flame in Gaul.\n\n'What if English toil and blood\nWas poured forth, even as a flood?\nIt availed, Oh, Liberty,\nTo dim, but not extinguish thee.\n\n'Thou art Love--the rich have kissed\nThy feet, and like him following Christ,\nGive their substance to the free\nAnd through the rough world follow thee,\n\n'Or turn their wealth to arms, and make\nWar for thy beloved sake\nOn wealth, and war, and fraud--whence they\nDrew the power which is their prey.\n\n'Science, Poetry, and Thought\nAre thy lamps; they make the lot\nOf the dwellers in a cot\nSo serene, they curse it not.\n\n'Spirit, Patience, Gentleness,\nAll that can adorn and bless\nArt thou--let deeds, not words, express\nThine exceeding loveliness.\n\n'Let a great Assembly be\nOf the fearless and the free\nOn some spot of English ground\nWhere the plains stretch wide around.\n\n'Let the blue sky overhead,\nThe green earth on which ye tread,\nAll that must eternal be\nWitness the solemnity.\n\n'From the corners uttermost\nOf the bounds of English coast;\nFrom every hut, village, and town\nWhere those who live and suffer moan\nFor others' misery or their own,\n\n'From the workhouse and the prison\nWhere pale as corpses newly risen,\nWomen, children, young and old\nGroan for pain, and weep for cold--\n\n'From the haunts of daily life\nWhere is waged the daily strife\nWith common wants and common cares\nWhich sows the human heart with tares--\n\n'Lastly from the palaces\nWhere the murmur of distress\nEchoes, like the distant sound\nOf a wind alive around\n\n'Those prison halls of wealth and fashion,\nWhere some few feel such compassion\nFor those who groan, and toil, and wail\nAs must make their brethren pale--\n\n'Ye who suffer woes untold,\nOr to feel, or to behold\nYour lost country bought and sold\nWith a price of blood and gold--\n\n'Let a vast assembly be,\nAnd with great solemnity\nDeclare with measured words that ye\nAre, as God has made ye, free--\n\n'Be your strong and simple words\nKeen to wound as sharpened swords,\nAnd wide as targes let them be,\nWith their shade to cover ye.\n\n'Let the tyrants pour around\nWith a quick and startling sound,\nLike the loosening of a sea,\nTroops of armed emblazonry.\n\n'Let the charged artillery drive\nTill the dead air seems alive\nWith the clash of clanging wheels,\nAnd the tramp of horses' heels.\n\n'Let the fixed bayonet\nGleam with sharp desire to wet\nIts bright point in English blood\nLooking keen as one for food.\n\nLet the horsemen's scimitars\nWheel and flash, like sphereless stars\nThirsting to eclipse their burning\nIn a sea of death and mourning.\n\n'Stand ye calm and resolute,\nLike a forest close and mute,\nWith folded arms and looks which are\nWeapons of unvanquished war,\n\n'And let Panic, who outspeeds\nThe career of armed steeds\nPass, a disregarded shade\nThrough your phalanx undismayed.\n\n'Let the laws of your own land,\nGood or ill, between ye stand\nHand to hand, and foot to foot,\nArbiters of the dispute,\n\n'The old laws of England--they\nWhose reverend heads with age are gray,\nChildren of a wiser day;\nAnd whose solemn voice must be\nThine own echo--Liberty!\n\n'On those who first should violate\nSuch sacred heralds in their state\nRest the blood that must ensue,\nAnd it will not rest on you.\n\n'And if then the tyrants dare\nLet them ride among you there,\nSlash, and stab, and maim, and hew,--\nWhat they like, that let them do.\n\n'With folded arms and steady eyes,\nAnd little fear, and less surprise,\nLook upon them as they slay\nTill their rage has died away.\n\nThen they will return with shame\nTo the place from which they came,\nAnd the blood thus shed will speak\nIn hot blushes on their cheek.\n\n'Every woman in the land\nWill point at them as they stand--\nThey will hardly dare to greet\nTheir acquaintance in the street.\n\n'And the bold, true warriors\nWho have hugged Danger in wars\nWill turn to those who would be free,\nAshamed of such base company.\n\n'And that slaughter to the Nation\nShall steam up like inspiration,\nEloquent, oracular;\nA volcano heard afar.\n\n'And these words shall then become\nLike Oppression's thundered doom\nRinging through each heart and brain,\nHeard again--again--again--\n\n'Rise like Lions after slumber\nIn unvanquishable number--\nShake your chains to earth like dew\nWhich in sleep had fallen on you--\nYe are many--they are few.'","title":"The Mask of Anarchy.

You will see\nThat which was Godwin,--greater none than he\nThough fallen--and fallen on evil times--to stand\nAmong the spirits of our age and land,\nBefore the dread tribunal of \"to come\"\nThe foremost,--while Rebuke cowers pale and dumb.\nYou will see Coleridge--he who sits obscure\nIn the exceeding lustre and the pure\nIntense irradiation of a mind,\nWhich, with its own internal lightning blind,\nFlags wearily through darkness and despair--\nA cloud-encircled meteor of the air,\nA hooded eagle among blinking owls.--\nYou will see Hunt--one of those happy souls\nWhich are the salt of the earth, and without whom\nThis world would smell like what it is--a tomb;\nWho is, what others seem; his room no doubt\nIs still adorned with many a cast from Shout,\nWith graceful flowers tastefully placed about;\nAnd coronals of bay from ribbons hung,\nAnd brighter wreaths in neat disorder flung;\nThe gifts of the most learned among some dozens\nOf female friends, sisters-in-law, and cousins.\nAnd there is he with his eternal puns,\nWhich beat the dullest brain for smiles, like duns\nThundering for money at a poet's door;\nAlas! it is no use to say, 'I'm poor!'\nOr oft in graver mood, when he will look\nThings wiser than were ever read in book,\nExcept in Shakespeare's wisest tenderness.--\nYou will see Hogg,--and I cannot express\nHis virtues,--though I know that they are great,\nBecause he locks, then barricades the gate\nWithin which they inhabit;--of his wit\nAnd wisdom, you'll cry out when you are bit.\nHe is a pearl within an oyster shell.\nOne of the richest of the deep;--and there\nIs English Peacock, with his mountain Fair,\nTurned into a Flamingo;--that shy bird\nThat gleams i' the Indian air--have you not heard\nWhen a man marries, dies, or turns Hindoo,\nHis best friends hear no more of him?--but you\nWill see him, and will like him too, I hope,\nWith the milk-white Snowdonian Antelope\nMatched with this cameleopard--his fine wit\nMakes such a wound, the knife is lost in it;\nA strain too learned for a shallow age,\nToo wise for selfish bigots; let his page,\nWhich charms the chosen spirits of the time,\nFold itself up for the serener clime\nOf years to come, and find its recompense\nIn that just expectation.--Wit and sense,\nVirtue and human knowledge; all that might\nMake this dull world a business of delight,\nAre all combined in Horace Smith.--And these.\nWith some exceptions, which I need not tease\nYour patience by descanting on,--are all\nYou and I know in London.\nI recall\nMy thoughts, and bid you look upon the night.\nAs water does a sponge, so the moonlight\nFills the void, hollow, universal air--\nWhat see you?--unpavilioned Heaven is fair,\nWhether the moon, into her chamber gone,\nLeaves midnight to the golden stars, or wan\nClimbs with diminished beams the azure steep;\nOr whether clouds sail o'er the inverse deep,\nPiloted by the many-wandering blast,\nAnd the rare stars rush through them dim and fast:--\nAll this is beautiful in every land.--\nBut what see you beside?--a shabby stand\nOf Hackney coaches--a brick house or wall\nFencing some lonely court, white with the scrawl\nOf our unhappy politics;--or worse--\nA wretched woman reeling by, whose curse\nMixed with the watchman's, partner of her trade,\nYou must accept in place of serenade--\nOr yellow-haired Pollonia murmuring\nTo Henry, some unutterable thing.\nI see a chaos of green leaves and fruit\nBuilt round dark caverns, even to the root\nOf the living stems that feed them--in whose bowers\nThere sleep in their dark dew the folded flowers;\nBeyond, the surface of the unsickled corn\nTrembles not in the slumbering air, and borne\nIn circles quaint, and ever-changing dance,\nLike winged stars the fire-flies flash and glance,\nPale in the open moonshine, but each one\nUnder the dark trees seems a little sun,\nA meteor tamed; a fixed star gone astray\nFrom the silver regions of the milky way;--\nAfar the Contadino's song is heard,\nRude, but made sweet by distance--and a bird\nWhich cannot be the Nightingale, and yet\nI know none else that sings so sweet as it\nAt this late hour;--and then all is still--\nNow--Italy or London, which you will!\n\nNext winter you must pass with me; I'll have\nMy house by that time turned into a grave\nOf dead despondence and low-thoughted care,\nAnd all the dreams which our tormentors are;\nOh! that Hunt, Hogg, Peacock, and Smith were there,\nWith everything belonging to them fair!--\nWe will have books, Spanish, Italian, Greek;\nAnd ask one week to make another week\nAs like his father, as I'm unlike mine,\nWhich is not his fault, as you may divine.\nThough we eat little flesh and drink no wine,\nYet let's be merry: we'll have tea and toast;\nCustards for supper, and an endless host\nOf syllabubs and jellies and mince-pies,\nAnd other such lady-like luxuries,--\nFeasting on which we will philosophize!\nAnd we'll have fires out of the Grand Duke's wood,\nTo thaw the six weeks' winter in our blood.\nAnd then we'll talk;--what shall we talk about?\nOh! there are themes enough for many a bout\nOf thought-entangled descant;--as to nerves--\nWith cones and parallelograms and curves\nI've sworn to strangle them if once they dare\nTo bother me--when you are with me there.\nAnd they shall never more sip laudanum,\nFrom Helicon or Himeros (1);--well, come,\nAnd in despite of God and of the devil,\nWe'll make our friendly philosophic revel\nOutlast the leafless time; till buds and flowers\nWarn the obscure inevitable hours,\nSweet meeting by sad parting to renew;--\n'To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.'","title":"Letter to Maria Gisborne"},{"lines":"PART 1.\n\nA Sensitive Plant in a garden grew,\nAnd the young winds fed it with silver dew,\nAnd it opened its fan-like leaves to the light.\nAnd closed them beneath the kisses of Night.\n\nAnd the Spring arose on the garden fair,\nLike the Spirit of Love felt everywhere;\nAnd each flower and herb on Earth's dark breast\nRose from the dreams of its wintry rest.\n\nBut none ever trembled and panted with bliss\nIn the garden, the field, or the wilderness,\nLike a doe in the noontide with love's sweet want,\nAs the companionless Sensitive Plant.\n\nThe snowdrop, and then the violet,\nArose from the ground with warm rain wet,\nAnd their breath was mixed with fresh odour, sent\nFrom the turf, like the voice and the instrument.\n\nThen the pied wind-flowers and the tulip tall,\nAnd narcissi, the fairest among them all,\nWho gaze on their eyes in the stream's recess,\nTill they die of their own dear loveliness;\n\nAnd the Naiad-like lily of the vale,\nWhom youth makes so fair and passion so pale\nThat the light of its tremulous bells is seen\nThrough their pavilions of tender green;\n\nAnd the hyacinth purple, and white, and blue,\nWhich flung from its bells a sweet peal anew\nOf music so delicate, soft, and intense,\nIt was felt like an odour within the sense;\n\nAnd the rose like a nymph to the bath addressed,\nWhich unveiled the depth of her glowing breast,\nTill, fold after fold, to the fainting air\nThe soul of her beauty and love lay bare:\n\nAnd the wand-like lily, which lifted up,\nAs a Maenad, its moonlight-coloured cup,\nTill the fiery star, which is its eye,\nGazed through clear dew on the tender sky;\n\nAnd the jessamine faint, and the sweet tuberose,\nThe sweetest flower for scent that blows;\nAnd all rare blossoms from every clime\nGrew in that garden in perfect prime.\n\nAnd on the stream whose inconstant bosom\nWas pranked, under boughs of embowering blossom,\nWith golden and green light, slanting through\nTheir heaven of many a tangled hue,\n\nBroad water-lilies lay tremulously,\nAnd starry river-buds glimmered by,\nAnd around them the soft stream did glide and dance\nWith a motion of sweet sound and radiance.\n\nAnd the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss,\nWhich led through the garden along and across,\nSome open at once to the sun and the breeze,\nSome lost among bowers of blossoming trees,\n\nWere all paved with daisies and delicate bells\nAs fair as the fabulous asphodels,\nAnd flow'rets which, drooping as day drooped too,\nFell into pavilions, white, purple, and blue,\nTo roof the glow-worm from the evening dew.\n\nAnd from this undefiled Paradise\nThe flowers (as an infant's awakening eyes\nSmile on its mother, whose singing sweet\nCan first lull, and at last must awaken it),\n\nWhen Heaven's blithe winds had unfolded them,\nAs mine-lamps enkindle a hidden gem,\nShone smiling to Heaven, and every one\nShared joy in the light of the gentle sun;\n\nFor each one was interpenetrated\nWith the light and the odour its neighbour shed,\nLike young lovers whom youth and love make dear\nWrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere.\n\nBut the Sensitive Plant which could give small fruit\nOf the love which it felt from the leaf to the root,\nReceived more than all, it loved more than ever,\nWhere none wanted but it, could belong to the giver,--\n\nFor the Sensitive Plant has no bright flower;\nRadiance and odour are not its dower;\nIt loves, even like Love, its deep heart is full,\nIt desires what it has not, the Beautiful!\n\nThe light winds which from unsustaining wings\nShed the music of many murmurings;\nThe beams which dart from many a star\nOf the flowers whose hues they bear afar;\n\nThe plumed insects swift and free,\nLike golden boats on a sunny sea,\nLaden with light and odour, which pass\nOver the gleam of the living grass;\n\nThe unseen clouds of the dew, which lie\nLike fire in the flowers till the sun rides high,\nThen wander like spirits among the spheres,\nEach cloud faint with the fragrance it bears;\n\nThe quivering vapours of dim noontide,\nWhich like a sea o'er the warm earth glide,\nIn which every sound, and odour, and beam,\nMove, as reeds in a single stream;\n\nEach and all like ministering angels were\nFor the Sensitive Plant sweet joy to bear,\nWhilst the lagging hours of the day went by\nLike windless clouds o'er a tender sky.\n\nAnd when evening descended from Heaven above,\nAnd the Earth was all rest, and the air was all love,\nAnd delight, though less bright, was far more deep,\nAnd the day's veil fell from the world of sleep,\n\nAnd the beasts, and the birds, and the insects were drowned\nIn an ocean of dreams without a sound;\nWhose waves never mark, though they ever impress\nThe light sand which paves it, consciousness;\n\n(Only overhead the sweet nightingale\nEver sang more sweet as the day might fail,\nAnd snatches of its Elysian chant\nWere mixed with the dreams of the Sensitive Plant);--\n\nThe Sensitive Plant was the earliest\nUpgathered into the bosom of rest;\nA sweet child weary of its delight,\nThe feeblest and yet the favourite,\nCradled within the embrace of Night.\n\nPART 2.\n\nThere was a Power in this sweet place,\nAn Eve in this Eden; a ruling Grace\nWhich to the flowers, did they waken or dream,\nWas as God is to the starry scheme.\n\nA Lady, the wonder of her kind,\nWhose form was upborne by a lovely mind\nWhich, dilating, had moulded her mien and motion\nLike a sea-flower unfolded beneath the ocean,\n\nTended the garden from morn to even:\nAnd the meteors of that sublunar Heaven,\nLike the lamps of the air when Night walks forth,\nLaughed round her footsteps up from the Earth!\n\nShe had no companion of mortal race,\nBut her tremulous breath and her flushing face\nTold, whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes,\nThat her dreams were less slumber than Paradise:\n\nAs if some bright Spirit for her sweet sake\nHad deserted Heaven while the stars were awake,\nAs if yet around her he lingering were,\nThough the veil of daylight concealed him from her.\n\nHer step seemed to pity the grass it pressed;\nYou might hear by the heaving of her breast,\nThat the coming and going of the wind\nBrought pleasure there and left passion behind.\n\nAnd wherever her aery footstep trod,\nHer trailing hair from the grassy sod\nErased its light vestige, with shadowy sweep,\nLike a sunny storm o'er the dark green deep.\n\nI doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet\nRejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet;\nI doubt not they felt the spirit that came\nFrom her glowing fingers through all their frame.\n\nShe sprinkled bright water from the stream\nOn those that were faint with the sunny beam;\nAnd out of the cups of the heavy flowers\nShe emptied the rain of the thunder-showers.\n\nShe lifted their heads with her tender hands,\nAnd sustained them with rods and osier-bands;\nIf the flowers had been her own infants, she\nCould never have nursed them more tenderly.\n\nAnd all killing insects and gnawing worms,\nAnd things of obscene and unlovely forms,\nShe bore, in a basket of Indian woof,\nInto the rough woods far aloof,--\n\nIn a basket, of grasses and wild-flowers full,\nThe freshest her gentle hands could pull\nFor the poor banished insects, whose intent,\nAlthough they did ill, was innocent.\n\nBut the bee and the beamlike ephemeris\nWhose path is the lightning's, and soft moths that kiss\nThe sweet lips of the flowers, and harm not, did she\nMake her attendant angels be.\n\nAnd many an antenatal tomb,\nWhere butterflies dream of the life to come,\nShe left clinging round the smooth and dark\nEdge of the odorous cedar bark.\n\nThis fairest creature from earliest Spring\nThus moved through the garden ministering\nMi the sweet season of Summertide,\nAnd ere the first leaf looked brown--she died!\n\nPART 3.\n\nThree days the flowers of the garden fair,\nLike stars when the moon is awakened, were,\nOr the waves of Baiae, ere luminous\nShe floats up through the smoke of Vesuvius.\n\nAnd on the fourth, the Sensitive Plant\nFelt the sound of the funeral chant,\nAnd the steps of the bearers, heavy and slow,\nAnd the sobs of the mourners, deep and low;\n\nThe weary sound and the heavy breath,\nAnd the silent motions of passing death,\nAnd the smell, cold, oppressive, and dank,\nSent through the pores of the coffin-plank;\n\nThe dark grass, and the flowers among the grass,\nWere bright with tears as the crowd did pass;\nFrom their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone,\nAnd sate in the pines, and gave groan for groan.\n\nThe garden, once fair, became cold and foul,\nLike the corpse of her who had been its soul,\nWhich at first was lovely as if in sleep,\nThen slowly changed, till it grew a heap\nTo make men tremble who never weep.\n\nSwift Summer into the Autumn flowed,\nAnd frost in the mist of the morning rode,\nThough the noonday sun looked clear and bright,\nMocking the spoil of the secret night.\n\nThe rose-leaves, like flakes of crimson snow,\nPaved the turf and the moss below.\nThe lilies were drooping, and white, and wan,\nLike the head and the skin of a dying man.\n\nAnd Indian plants, of scent and hue\nThe sweetest that ever were fed on dew,\nLeaf by leaf, day after day,\nWere massed into the common clay.\n\nAnd the leaves, brown, yellow, and gray, and red,\nAnd white with the whiteness of what is dead,\nLike troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed;\nTheir whistling noise made the birds aghast.\n\nAnd the gusty winds waked the winged seeds,\nOut of their birthplace of ugly weeds,\nTill they clung round many a sweet flower's stem,\nWhich rotted into the earth with them.\n\nThe water-blooms under the rivulet\nFell from the stalks on which they were set;\nAnd the eddies drove them here and there,\nAs the winds did those of the upper air.\n\nThen the rain came down, and the broken stalks\nWere bent and tangled across the walks;\nAnd the leafless network of parasite bowers\nMassed into ruin; and all sweet flowers.\n\nBetween the time of the wind and the snow\nAll loathliest weeds began to grow,\nWhose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck,\nLike the water-snake's belly and the toad's back.\n\nAnd thistles, and nettles, and darnels rank,\nAnd the dock, and henbane, and hemlock dank,\nStretched out its long and hollow shank,\nAnd stifled the air till the dead wind stank.\n\nAnd plants, at whose names the verse feels loath,\nFilled the place with a monstrous undergrowth,\nPrickly, and pulpous, and blistering, and blue,\nLivid, and starred with a lurid dew.\n\nAnd agarics, and fungi, with mildew and mould\nStarted like mist from the wet ground cold;\nPale, fleshy, as if the decaying dead\nWith a spirit of growth had been animated!\n\nSpawn, weeds, and filth, a leprous scum,\nMade the running rivulet thick and dumb,\nAnd at its outlet flags huge as stakes\nDammed it up with roots knotted like water-snakes.\n\nAnd hour by hour, when the air was still,\nThe vapours arose which have strength to kill;\nAt morn they were seen, at noon they were felt,\nAt night they were darkness no star could melt.\n\nAnd unctuous meteors from spray to spray\nCrept and flitted in broad noonday\nUnseen; every branch on which they alit\nBy a venomous blight was burned and bit.\n\nThe Sensitive Plant, like one forbid,\nWept, and the tears within each lid\nOf its folded leaves, which together grew,\nWere changed to a blight of frozen glue.\n\nFor the leaves soon fell, and the branches soon\nBy the heavy axe of the blast were hewn;\nThe sap shrank to the root through every pore\nAs blood to a heart that will beat no more.\n\nFor Winter came: the wind was his whip:\nOne choppy finger was on his lip:\nHe had torn the cataracts from the hills\nAnd they clanked at his girdle like manacles;\n\nHis breath was a chain which without a sound\nThe earth, and the air, and the water bound;\nHe came, fiercely driven, in his chariot-throne\nBy the tenfold blasts of the Arctic zone.\n\nThen the weeds which were forms of living death\nFled from the frost to the earth beneath.\nTheir decay and sudden flight from frost\nWas but like the vanishing of a ghost!\n\nAnd under the roots of the Sensitive Plant\nThe moles and the dormice died for want:\nThe birds dropped stiff from the frozen air\nAnd were caught in the branches naked and bare.\n\nFirst there came down a thawing rain\nAnd its dull drops froze on the boughs again;\nThen there steamed up a freezing dew\nWhich to the drops of the thaw-rain grew;\n\nAnd a northern whirlwind, wandering about\nLike a wolf that had smelt a dead child out,\nShook the boughs thus laden, and heavy, and stiff,\nAnd snapped them off with his rigid griff.\n\nWhen Winter had gone and Spring came back\nThe Sensitive Plant was a leafless wreck;\nBut the mandrakes, and toadstools, and docks, and darnels,\nRose like the dead from their ruined charnels.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\nWhether the Sensitive Plant, or that\nWhich within its boughs like a Spirit sat,\nEre its outward form had known decay,\nNow felt this change, I cannot say.\n\nWhether that Lady's gentle mind,\nNo longer with the form combined\nWhich scattered love, as stars do light,\nFound sadness, where it left delight,\n\nI dare not guess; but in this life\nOf error, ignorance, and strife,\nWhere nothing is, but all things seem,\nAnd we the shadows of the dream,\n\nIt is a modest creed, and yet\nPleasant if one considers it,\nTo own that death itself must be,\nLike all the rest, a mockery.\n\nThat garden sweet, that lady fair,\nAnd all sweet shapes and odours there,\nIn truth have never passed away:\n'Tis we, 'tis ours, are changed; not they.\n\nFor love, and beauty, and delight,\nThere is no death nor change: their might\nExceeds our organs, which endure\nNo light, being themselves obscure.\n\nCANCELLED PASSAGE.\n\nTheir moss rotted off them, flake by flake,\nTill the thick stalk stuck like a murderer's stake,\nWhere rags of loose flesh yet tremble on high,\nInfecting the winds that wander by.","title":"The Sensitive Plant"},{"lines":"His face was like a snake's--wrinkled and loose\nAnd

OF CALDERON.\n\nSCENE 1:\n\nENTER CYPRIAN, DRESSED AS A STUDENT;\nCLARIN AND MOSCON AS POOR SCHOLARS, WITH BOOKS.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nIn the sweet solitude of this calm place,\nThis intricate wild wilderness of trees\nAnd flowers and undergrowth of odorous plants,\nLeave me; the books you brought out of the house\nTo me are ever best society.\nAnd while with glorious festival and song,\nAntioch now celebrates the consecration\nOf a proud temple to great Jupiter,\nAnd bears his image in loud jubilee\nTo its new shrine, I would consume what still\nLives of the dying day in studious thought,\nFar from the throng and turmoil. You, my friends,\nGo, and enjoy the festival; it will\nBe worth your pains. You may return for me\nWhen the sun seeks its grave among the billows\nWhich, among dim gray clouds on the horizon,\nDance like white plumes upon a hearse;-- and here\nI shall expect you.\n\nMOSCON:\nI cannot bring my mind,\nGreat as my haste to see the festival\nCertainly is, to leave you, Sir, without\nJust saying some three or four thousand words.\nHow is it possible that on a day\nOf such festivity, you can be content\nTo come forth to a solitary country\nWith three or four old books, and turn your back\nOn all this mirth?\n\nCLARIN:\nMy master's in the right;\nThere is not anything more tiresome\nThan a procession day, with troops, and priests,\nAnd dances, and all that.\n\nMOSCON:\nFrom first to last,\nClarin, you are a temporizing flatterer;\nYou praise not what you feel but what he does;--\nToadeater!\n\nCLARIN:\nYou lie--under a mistake--\nFor this is the most civil sort of lie\nThat can be given to a man's face. I now\nSay what I think.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nEnough, you foolish fellows!\nPuffed up with your own doting ignorance,\nYou always take the two sides of one question.\nNow go; and as I said, return for me\nWhen night falls, veiling in its shadows wide\nThis glorious fabric of the universe.\n\nMOSCON:\nHow happens it, although you can maintain\nThe folly of enjoying festivals,\nThat yet you go there?\n\nCLARIN:\nNay, the consequence\nIs clear:--who ever did what he advises\nOthers to do?--\n\nMOSCON:\nWould that my feet were wings,\nSo would I fly to Livia.\n\n[EXIT.]\n\nCLARIN:\nTo speak truth,\nLivia is she who has surprised my heart;\nBut he is more than half-way there.--Soho!\nLivia, I come; good sport, Livia, soho!\n\n[EXIT.]\n\nCYPRIAN:\nNow, since I am alone, let me examine\nThe question which has long disturbed my mind\nWith doubt, since first I read in Plinius\nThe words of mystic import and deep sense\nIn which he defines God. My intellect\nCan find no God with whom these marks and signs\nFitly agree. It is a hidden truth\nWhich I must fathom.\n\n[CYPRIAN READS;\nTHE DAEMON, DRESSED IN A COURT DRESS, ENTERS.]\n\nDAEMON:\nSearch even as thou wilt,\nBut thou shalt never find what I can hide.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nWhat noise is that among the boughs? Who moves?\nWhat art thou?--\n\nDAEMON:\n'Tis a foreign gentleman.\nEven from this morning I have lost my way\nIn this wild place; and my poor horse at last,\nQuite overcome, has stretched himself upon\nThe enamelled tapestry of this mossy mountain,\nAnd feeds and rests at the same time. I was\nUpon my way to Antioch upon business\nOf some importance, but wrapped up in cares\n(Who is exempt from this inheritance?)\nI parted from my company, and lost\nMy way, and lost my servants and my comrades.\n\nCYPRIAN:\n'Tis singular that even within the sight\nOf the high towers of Antioch you could lose\nYour way. Of all the avenues and green paths\nOf this wild wood there is not one but leads,\nAs to its centre, to the walls of Antioch;\nTake which you will, you cannot miss your road.\n\nDAEMON:\nAnd such is ignorance! Even in the sight\nOf knowledge, it can draw no profit from it.\nBut as it still is early, and as I\nHave no acquaintances in Antioch,\nBeing a stranger there, I will even wait\nThe few surviving hours of the day,\nUntil the night shall conquer it. I see\nBoth by your dress and by the books in which\nYou find delight and company, that you\nAre a great student;--for my part, I feel\nMuch sympathy in such pursuits.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nHave you\nStudied much?\n\nDAEMON:\nNo,--and yet I know enough\nNot to be wholly ignorant.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nPray, Sir,\nWhat science may you know?--\n\nDAEMON:\nMany.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nAlas!\nMuch pains must we expend on one alone,\nAnd even then attain it not;--but you\nHave the presumption to assert that you\nKnow many without study.\n\nDAEMON:\nAnd with truth.\nFor in the country whence I come the sciences\nRequire no learning,--they are known.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nOh, would\nI were of that bright country! for in this\nThe more we study, we the more discover\nOur ignorance.\n\nDAEMON:\nIt is so true, that I\nHad so much arrogance as to oppose\nThe chair of the most high Professorship,\nAnd obtained many votes, and, though I lost,\nThe attempt was still more glorious, than the failure\nCould be dishonourable. If you believe not,\nLet us refer it to dispute respecting\nThat which you know the best, and although I\nKnow not the opinion you maintain, and though\nIt be the true one, I will take the contrary.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nThe offer gives me pleasure. I am now\nDebating with myself upon a passage\nOf Plinius, and my mind is racked with doubt\nTo understand and know who is the God\nOf whom he speaks.\n\nDAEMON:\nIt is a passage, if\nI recollect it right, couched in these words\n'God is one supreme goodness, one pure essence,\nOne substance, and one sense, all sight, all hands.'\n\nCYPRIAN:\n'Tis true.\n\nDAEMON:\nWhat difficulty find you here?\n\nCYPRIAN:\nI do not recognize among the Gods\nThe God defined by Plinius; if he must\nBe supreme goodness, even Jupiter\nIs not supremely good; because we see\nHis deeds are evil, and his attributes\nTainted with mortal weakness; in what manner\nCan supreme goodness be consistent with\nThe passions of humanity?\n\nDAEMON:\nThe wisdom\nOf the old world masked with the names of Gods\nThe attributes of Nature and of Man;\nA sort of popular philosophy.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nThis reply will not satisfy me, for\nSuch awe is due to the high name of God\nThat ill should never be imputed. Then,\nExamining the question with more care,\nIt follows, that the Gods would always will\nThat which is best, were they supremely good.\nHow then does one will one thing, one another?\nAnd that you may not say that I allege\nPoetical or philosophic learning:--\nConsider the ambiguous responses\nOf their oracular statues; from two shrines\nTwo armies shall obtain the assurance of\nOne victory. Is it not indisputable\nThat two contending wills can never lead\nTo the same end? And, being opposite,\nIf one be good, is not the other evil?\nEvil in God is inconceivable;\nBut supreme goodness fails among the Gods\nWithout their union.\n\nDAEMON:\nI deny your major.\nThese responses are means towards some end\nUnfathomed by our intellectual beam.\nThey are the work of Providence, and more\nThe battle's loss may profit those who lose,\nThan victory advantage those who win.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nThat I admit; and yet that God should not\n(Falsehood is incompatible with deity)\nAssure the victory; it would be enough\nTo have permitted the defeat. If God\nBe all sight,--God, who had beheld the truth,\nWould not have given assurance of an end\nNever to be accomplished: thus, although\nThe Deity may according to his attributes\nBe well distinguished into persons, yet\nEven in the minutest circumstance\nHis essence must be one.\n\nDAEMON:\nTo attain the end\nThe affections of the actors in the scene\nMust have been thus influenced by his voice.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nBut for a purpose thus subordinate\nHe might have employed Genii, good or evil,--\nA sort of spirits called so by the learned,\nWho roam about inspiring good or evil,\nAnd from whose influence and existence we\nMay well infer our immortality.\nThus God might easily, without descent\nTo a gross falsehood in his proper person,\nHave moved the affections by this mediation\nTo the just point.\n\nDAEMON:\nThese trifling contradictions\nDo not suffice to impugn the unity\nOf the high Gods; in things of great importance\nThey still appear unanimous; consider\nThat glorious fabric, man,--his workmanship\nIs stamped with one conception.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nWho made man\nMust have, methinks, the advantage of the others.\nIf they are equal, might they not have risen\nIn opposition to the work, and being\nAll hands, according to our author here,\nHave still destroyed even as the other made?\nIf equal in their power, unequal only\nIn opportunity, which of the two\nWill remain conqueror?\n\nDAEMON:\nOn impossible\nAnd false hypothesis there can be built\nNo argument. Say, what do you infer\nFrom this?\n\nCYPRIAN:\nThat there must be a mighty God\nOf supreme goodness and of highest grace,\nAll sight, all hands, all truth, infallible,\nWithout an equal and without a rival,\nThe cause of all things and the effect of nothing,\nOne power, one will, one substance, and one essence.\nAnd, in whatever persons, one or two,\nHis attributes may be distinguished, one\nSovereign power, one solitary essence,\nOne cause of all cause.\n\n[THEY RISE.]\n\nDAEMON:\nHow can I impugn\nSo clear a consequence?\n\nCYPRIAN:\nDo you regret\nMy victory?\n\nDAEMON:\nWho but regrets a check\nIn rivalry of wit? I could reply\nAnd urge new difficulties, but will now\nDepart, for I hear steps of men approaching,\nAnd it is time that I should now pursue\nMy journey to the city.\n\nCYPRIAN:\nGo in peace!\n\nDAEMON:\nRemain in peace!--Since thus it profits him\nTo study, I will wrap his senses up\nIn sweet oblivion of all thought but of\nA piece of excellent beauty; and, as I\nHave power given me to wage enmity\nAgainst Justina's soul, I will extract\nFrom one effect two vengeances.\n\n[ASIDE AND EXIT.]\n\nCYPRIAN:\nI never\nMet a more learned person. Let me now\nRevolve this doubt again with careful mind.\n\n[HE READS.]\n\n[FLORO AND LELIO ENTER.]\n\nLELIO:\nHere stop. These toppling rocks and tangled boughs,\nImpenetrable by the noonday beam,\nShall be sole witnesses of what we--\n\nFLORO:\nDraw!\nIf there were words, here is the place for deeds.\n\nLELIO:\nThou needest not instruct me; well I know\nThat in the field, the silent tongue of steel\nSpeaks thus,--\n\n[THEY FIGHT.]\n\nCYPRIAN:\nHa! what is this? Lelio,--Floro,\nBe it enough that Cyprian stands between you,\nAlthough unarmed.\n\nLELIO:\nWhence comest thou, to stand\nBetween me and my vengeance?\n\nFLORO:\nFrom what rocks\nAnd desert cells?\n\n[ENTER MOSCON AND CLARIN.]\n\nMOSCON:\nRun! run! for where we left\nMy master. I now hear the clash of swords.\n\nCLARIN:\nI never run to approach things of this sort\nBut only to avoid them. Sir! Cyprian! sir!\n\nCYPRIAN:\nBe silent, fellows! What! two friends who are\nIn blood and fame the eyes and hope of Antioch,\nOne of the noble race of the Colalti,\nThe other son o' the Governor, adventure\nAnd cast away, on some slight cause no doubt,\nTwo lives, the honour of their country?\n\nLELIO:\nCyprian!\nAlthough my high respect towards your person\nHolds now my sword suspended, thou canst not\nRestore it to the slumber of the scabbard:\nThou knowest more of science than the duel;\nFor when two men of honour take the field,\nNo counsel nor respect can make them friends\nBut one must die in the dispute.\n\nFLORO:\nI pray\nThat you depart hence with your people, and\nLeave us to finish what we have begun\nWithout advantage.--\n\nCYPRIAN:\nThough you may imagine\nThat I know little of the laws of duel,\nWhich vanity and valour instituted,\nYou are in error.

weeps not, yet often and deeply she sighs,\nShe never complains, but her silence implies\nThe composure of settled distress.\n\n\nII.\n\nNo aid, no compassion the Maniac will seek,\nCold and hunger awake not her care:\nThro' her rags do the winds of the winter blow bleak\nOn her poor withered bosom half bare, and her cheek\nHas the deathy pale hue of despair.\n\n\nIII.\n\nYet chearful and happy, nor distant the day,\nPoor Mary the Maniac has been;\nThe Traveller remembers who journeyed this way\nNo damsel so lovely, no damsel so gay\nAs Mary the Maid of the Inn.\n\n\nIV.\n\nHer chearful address fill'd the guests with delight\nAs she welcomed them in with a smile:\nHer heart was a stranger to childish affright,\nAnd Mary would walk by the Abbey at night\nWhen the wind whistled down the dark aisle.\n\n\nV.\n\nShe loved, and young Richard had settled the day,\nAnd she hoped to be happy for life;\nBut Richard was idle and worthless, and they\nWho knew him would pity poor Mary and say\nThat she was too good for his wife.\n\n\nVI.\n\n'Twas in autumn, and stormy and dark was the night,\nAnd fast were the windows and door;\nTwo guests sat enjoying the fire that burnt bright,\nAnd smoking in silence with tranquil delight\nThey listen'd to hear the wind roar.\n\n\nVII.\n\n\"Tis pleasant,\" cried one, \"seated by the fire side\n\"To hear the wind whistle without.\"\n\"A fine night for the Abbey!\" his comrade replied,\n\"Methinks a man's courage would now be well tried\n\"Who should wander the ruins about.\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\"I myself, like a school-boy, should tremble to hear\n\"The hoarse ivy shake over my head;\n\"And could fancy I saw, half persuaded by fear,\n\"Some ugly old Abbot's white spirit appear,\n\"For this wind might awaken the dead!\"\n\n\nIX.\n\n\"I'll wager a dinner,\" the other one cried,\n\"That Mary would venture there now.\"\n\"Then wager and lose!\" with a sneer he replied,\n\"I'll warrant she'd fancy a ghost by her side,\n\"And faint if she saw a white cow.\"\n\n\nX.\n\n\"Will Mary this charge on her courage allow?\"\nHis companion exclaim'd with a smile;\n\"I shall win, for I know she will venture there now,\n\"And earn a new bonnet by bringing a bough\n\"From the elder that grows in the aisle.\"\n\n\nXI.\n\nWith fearless good humour did Mary comply,\nAnd her way to the Abbey she bent;\nThe night it was dark, and the wind it was high\nAnd as hollowly howling it swept thro' the sky\nShe shiver'd with cold as she went.\n\n\nXII.\n\nO'er the path so well known still proceeded the Maid\nWhere the Abbey rose dim on the sight,\nThro' the gate-way she entered, she felt not afraid\nYet the ruins were lonely and wild, and their shade\nSeem'd to deepen the gloom of the night.\n\n\nXIII.\n\nAll around her was silent, save when the rude blast\nHowl'd dismally round the old pile;\nOver weed-cover'd fragments still fearless she past,\nAnd arrived in the innermost ruin at last\nWhere the elder tree grew in the aisle.\n\n\nXIV.\n\nWell-pleas'd did she reach it, and quickly drew near\nAnd hastily gather'd the bough:\nWhen the sound of a voice seem'd to rise on her ear,\nShe paus'd, and she listen'd, all eager to hear,\nAud her heart panted fearfully now.\n\n\nXV.\n\nThe wind blew, the hoarse ivy shook over her head,\nShe listen'd,--nought else could she hear.\nThe wind ceas'd, her heart sunk in her bosom with dread\nFor she heard in the ruins distinctly the tread\nOf footsteps approaching her near.\n\n\nXVI.\n\nBehind a wide column half breathless with fear\nShe crept to conceal herself there:\nThat instant the moon o'er a dark cloud shone clear,\nAnd she saw in the moon-light two ruffians appear\nAnd between them a corpse did they bear.\n\n\nXVII.\n\nThen Mary could feel her heart-blood curdle cold!\nAgain the rough wind hurried by,--\nIt blew off the hat of the one, and behold\nEven close to the feet of poor Mary it roll'd,--\nShe felt, and expected to die.\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n\"Curse the hat!\" he exclaims. \"Nay come on and first hide\n\"The dead body,\" his comrade replies.\nShe beheld them in safety pass on by her side,\nShe seizes the hat, fear her courage supplied,\nAnd fast thro' the Abbey she flies.\n\n\nXIX.\n\nShe ran with wild speed, she rush'd in at the door,\nShe gazed horribly eager around,\nThen her limbs could support their faint burthen no more,\nAnd exhausted and breathless she sunk on the floor\nUnable to utter a sound.\n\n\nXX.\n\nEre yet her pale lips could the story impart,\nFor a moment the hat met her view;--\nHer eyes from that object convulsively start,\nFor--oh God what cold horror then thrill'd thro' her heart,\nWhen the name of her Richard she knew!\n\n\nXXI.\n\nWhere the old Abbey stands, on the common hard by\nHis gibbet is now to be

O ye who weep\nMuch for the many miseries of Mankind,\nMore for their vices, ye whose honest eyes\nFrown on OPPRESSION,--ye whose honest hearts\nBeat high when FREEDOM sounds her dread tocsin;--\nO ye who quit the path of peaceful life\nCrusading for mankind--a spaniel race\nThat lick the hand that beats them, or tear all\nAlike in frenzy--to your HOUSEHOLD GODS\nReturn, for by their altars VIRTUE dwells\nAnd HAPPINESS with her; for by their fires\nTRANQUILLITY in no unsocial mood\nSits silent, listening to the pattering shower;\nFor, so SUSPICION sleep not at the gate\nOf WISDOM,--FALSEHOOD shall not enter there.\n\nAs on the height of some huge eminence,\nReach'd with long labour, the way-faring man\nPauses awhile, and gazing o'er the plain\nWith many a sore step travelled, turns him then\nSerious to contemplate the onward road,\nAnd calls to mind the comforts of his home,\nAnd sighs that he has left them, and resolves\nTo stray no more: I on my way of life\nMuse thus PENATES, and with firmest faith\nDevote myself to you. I will not quit\nTo mingle with the mob your calm abodes,\nWhere, by the evening hearth CONTENTMENT sits\nAnd hears the cricket chirp; where LOVE delights\nTo dwell, and on your altars lays his torch\nThat burns with no extinguishable flame.\n\nHear me ye POWERS benignant! there is one\nMust be mine inmate--for I may not chuse\nBut love him. He is one whom many wrongs\nHave sicken'd of the world. There was a time\nWhen he would weep to hear of wickedness\nAnd wonder at the tale; when for the opprest\nHe felt a brother's pity, to the oppressor\nA good man's honest anger. His quick eye\nBetray'd each rising feeling, every thought\nLeapt to his tongue. When first among mankind\nHe mingled, by himself he judged of them,\nAnd loved and trusted them, to Wisdom deaf,\nAnd took them to his bosom. FALSEHOOD met\nHer unsuspecting victim, fair of front,\nAnd lovely as Apega's sculptured form,\nLike that false image caught his warm embrace\nAnd gored his open breast. The reptile race\nClung round his bosom, and with viper folds\nEncircling, stung the fool who fostered them.\nHis mother was SIMPLICITY, his sire\nBENEVOLENCE; in earlier days he bore\nHis father's name; the world who injured him\nCall him MISANTHROPY. I may not chuse\nBut love him, HOUSEHOLD GODS! for we were nurst\nIn the same school.\n\nPENATES! some there are\nWho say, that not in the inmost heaven ye dwell,\nGazing with eye remote on all the ways\nOf man, his GUARDIAN GODS; wiselier they deem\nA dearer interest to the human race\nLinks you, yourselves the SPIRITS OF THE DEAD.\nNo mortal eye may pierce the invisible world,\nNo light of human reason penetrate\nThat depth where Truth lies hid. Yet to this faith\nMy heart with instant sympathy assents;\nAnd I would judge all systems and all faiths\nBy that best touchstone, from whose test DECEIT\nShrinks like the Arch-Fiend at Ithuriel's spear,\nAnd SOPHISTRY'S gay glittering bubble bursts,\nAs at the spousals of the Nereid's son,\nWhen that false Florimel, by her prototype\nDisplay'd in rivalry, with all her charms\nDissolved away.\n\nNor can the halls of Heaven\nGive to the human soul such kindred joy,\nAs hovering o'er its earthly haunts it feels,\nWhen with the breeze it wantons round the brow\nOf one beloved on earth; or when at night\nIn dreams it comes, and brings with it the DAYS\nAnd JOYS that are no more, Or when, perchance\nWith power permitted to alleviate ill\nAnd fit the sufferer for the coming woe,\nSome strange presage the SPIRIT breathes, and fills\nThe breast with ominous fear, and disciplines\nFor sorrow, pours into the afflicted heart\nThe balm of resignation, and inspires\nWith heavenly hope. Even as a Child delights\nTo visit day by day the favorite plant\nHis hand has sown, to mark its gradual growth,\nAnd watch all anxious for the promised flower;\nThus to the blessed spirit, in innocence\nAnd pure affections like a little child,\nSweet will it be to hover o'er the friends\nBeloved; then sweetest if, as Duty prompts,\nWith earthly care we in their breasts have sown\nThe seeds of Truth and Virtue, holy flowers\nWhose odour reacheth Heaven.\n\nWhen my sick Heart,\n(Sick with hope long delayed, than, which no care\nPresses the crush'd heart heavier from itself\nSeeks the best comfort, often have I deemed\nThat thou didst witness every inmost thought\nSEWARD! my dear dead friend! for not in vain,\nOh early summon'd in thy heavenly course!\nWas thy brief sojourn here: me didst thou leave\nWith strengthen'd step to follow the right path\nTill we shall meet again. Meantime I soothe\nThe deep regret of Nature, with belief,\nMy EDMUND! that thine eye's celestial ken\nPervades me now, marking no mean joy\nThe movements of the heart that loved thee well!\n\nSuch feelings Nature prompts, and hence your rites\nDOMESTIC GODS! arose. When for his son\nWith ceaseless grief Syrophanes bewail'd,\nMourning his age left childless, and his wealth\nHeapt for an alien, he with fixed eye\nStill on the imaged marble of the dead\nDwelt, pampering sorrow. Thither from his wrath\nA safe asylum, fled the offending slave,\nAnd garlanded the statue and implored\nHis young lost Lord to save: Remembrance then\nSoftened the father, and he loved to see\nThe votive wreath renewed, and the rich smoke\nCurl from the costly censer slow and sweet.\nFrom Egypt soon the sorrow-soothing rites\nDivulging spread; before your idol forms\nBy every hearth the blinded Pagan knelt,\nPouring his prayers to these, and offering there\nVain sacrifice or impious, and sometimes\nWith human blood your sanctuary defil'd:\nTill the first BRUTUS, tyrant-conquering chief,\nArose; he first the impious rites put down,\nHe fitliest, who for FREEDOM lived and died,\nThe friend of humankind. Then did your feasts\nFrequent recur and blameless; and when came\nThe solemn festival, whose happiest rites\nEmblem'd EQUALITY, the holiest truth!\nCrown'd with gay garlands were your statues seen,\nTo you the fragrant censer smok'd, to you\nThe rich libation flow'd: vain sacrifice!\nFor nor the poppy wreath nor fruits nor wine.\nYe ask, PENATES! nor the altar cleans'd\nWith many a mystic form; ye ask the heart\nMade pure, and by domestic Peace and Love\nHallowed to you.\n\nHearken your hymn of praise,\nPENATES! to your shrines I come for rest,\nThere only to be found. Often at eve,\nAmid my wanderings I have seen far off\nThe lonely light that spake of comfort there,\nIt told my heart of many a joy of home,\nAnd my poor heart was sad. When I have gazed\nFrom some high eminence on goodly vales\nAnd cots and villages embower'd below,\nThe thought would rise that all to me was strange\nAmid the scene so fair, nor one small spot\nWhere my tir'd mind might rest and call it home,\nThere is a magic in that little word;\nIt is a mystic circle that surrounds\nComforts and Virtues never known beyond\nThe hallowed limit. Often has my heart\nAched for that quiet haven; haven'd now,\nI think of those in this world's wilderness\nWho wander on and find no home of rest\nTill to the grave they go! them POVERTY\nHollow-eyed fiend, the child of WEALTH and POWER,\nBad offspring of worse parents, aye afflicts,\nCankering with her foul mildews the chill'd heart--\nThem WANT with scorpion scourge drives to the den\nOf GUILT--them SLAUGHTER with the price of death\nBuys for her raven brood. Oh not on them\nGOD OF ETERNAL JUSTICE! not on them\nLet fall thy thunder!\n\nHOUSEHOLD DEITIES!\nThen only shall be Happiness on earth\nWhen Man shall feel your sacred power, and love\nYour tranquil joys; then shall the city stand\nA huge void sepulchre, and rising fair\nAmid the ruins of the palace pile\nThe Olive grow, there shall the TREE OF PEACE\nStrike its roots deep and flourish. This the state\nShall bless the race redeemed of Man, when WEALTH\nAnd POWER and all their hideous progeny\nShall sink annihilate, and all mankind\nLive in the equal brotherhood of LOVE.\nHeart-calming hope and sure! for hitherward\nTend all the tumults of the troubled world,\nIts woes, its wisdom, and its wickedness\nAlike: so he hath will'd whose will is just.\n\nMeantime, all hoping and expecting all\nIn patient faith, to you, DOMESTIC GODS!\nI come, studious of other lore than song,\nOf my past years the solace and support:\nYet shall my Heart remember the past years\nWith honest pride, trusting that not in vain\nLives the pure song of LIBERTY and TRUTH.","title":"Hymn To The Penates"},{"lines":"What! and not one to heave the pious sigh!\nNot one whose sorrow-swoln and aching eye\nFor social scenes, for life's endearments fled,\nShall drop a tear and dwell upon the dead!\nPoor wretched Outcast!

dance.\nExalted on the Monarch's golden throne\nIn royal state the fair Apame shone;\n\nHer form of majesty, her eyes of fire\nChill with respect, or kindle with desire.\nThe admiring multitude her charms adore,\nAnd own her worthy of the crown she wore.\n\nNow on his couch reclin'd Darius lay,\nTir'd with the toilsome pleasures of the day;\nWithout Judaea's watchful sons await\nTo guard the sleeping pageant of the state.\nThree youths were these of Judah's royal race,\nThree youths whom Nature dower'd with every grace,\nTo each the form of symmetry she gave,\nAnd haughty Genius curs'd each favorite slave;\nThese fill'd the cup, around the Monarch kept,\nServ'd as he spake, and guarded whilst he slept.\n\nYet oft for Salem's hallowed towers laid low\nThe sigh would heave, the unbidden tear would flow;\nAnd when the dull and wearying round of Power\nAllowed Zorobabel one vacant hour,\nHe lov'd on Babylon's high wall to roam,\nAnd stretch the gaze towards his distant home,\nOr on Euphrates' willowy banks reclin'd\nHear the sad harp moan fitful to the wind.\n\nAs now the perfum'd lamps stream wide their light,\nAnd social converse chears the livelong night,\nThus spake Zorobabel, \"too long in vain\n\"For Sion desolate her sons complain;\n\"In anguish worn the joyless years lag slow,\n\"And these proud conquerors mock their captive's woe.\n\"Whilst Cyrus triumph'd here in victor state\n\"A brighter prospect chear'd our exil'd fate,\n\"Our sacred walls again he bade us raise,\n\"And to Jehovah rear the pile of praise.\n\"Quickly these fond hopes faded

flute,\nThe cornet, sackbut, dulcimer, and lute;\nTo Babylon's gay streets the throng resort,\nSwarm thro' the gates, and fill the festive court.\nHigh on his throne Darius tower'd in pride,\nThe fair Apame grac'd the Sovereign's side;\nAnd now she smil'd, and now with mimic frown\nPlaced on her brow the Monarch's sacred crown.\nIn transport o'er her faultless form he bends,\nLoves every look, and every act commends.\n\nAnd now Darius bids the herald call\nJudaea's Bard to grace the thronging hall.\nHush'd is each sound--the attending crowd are mute,\nThe Hebrew lightly strikes the chearful lute:\n\nWhen the Traveller on his way,\nWho has toil'd the livelong day,\nFeels around on every side\nThe chilly mists of eventide,\nFatigued and faint his wearied mind\nRecurs to all he leaves behind;\nHe thinks upon the well-trimm'd hearth,\nThe evening hour of social mirth,\nAnd her who at departing day\nWeeps for her husband far away.\nOh give to him the flowing bowl,\nBid it renovate his soul;\nThen shall sorrow sink to sleep,\nAnd he who wept, no more shall weep;\nFor his care-clouded brow shall clear,\nAnd his glad eye shall sparkle thro' the tear.\n\nWhen the poor man heart-opprest\nBetakes him to his evening rest,\nAnd worn with labour thinks in sorrow\nOf the labor of to-morrow;\nWhen sadly musing on his lot\nHe hies him to his joyless cot,\nAnd loathes to meet his children there,\nThe rivals for his scanty fare:\nOh give to him the flowing bowl,\nBid it renovate his soul;\nThe generous juice with magic power\nShall cheat with happiness the hour,\nAnd with each warm affection fill\nThe heart by want and wretchedness made chill.\n\nWhen, at the dim close of day,\nThe Captive loves alone to stray\nAlong the haunts recluse and rude\nOf sorrow and of solitude;\nWhen he sits with moveless eye\nTo mark the lingering radiance die,\nAnd lets distemper'd Fancy roam\nAmid the ruins of his home,--\nOh give to him the flowing bowl,\nBid it renovate his soul;\nThe bowl shall better thoughts bestow,\nAnd lull to rest his wakeful woe,\nAnd Joy shall bless the evening hour,\nAnd make the Captive Fortune's conqueror.\n\nWhen the wearying cares of state\nOppress the Monarch with their weight,\nWhen from his pomp retir'd alone\nHe feels the duties of the throne,\nFeels that the multitude below\nDepend on him for weal or woe;\nWhen his powerful will may bless\nA realm with peace and happiness,\nOr with desolating breath\nBreathe ruin round, and woe, and death:\nOh give to him the flowing bowl,\nBid it humanize his soul;\nHe shall not feel the empire's weight,\nHe shall not feel the cares of state,\nThe bowl shall each dark thought beguile,\nAnd Nations live and prosper from his smile.\n\nHusht was the lute, the Hebrew ceas'd the song;\nLong peals of plaudits echoed from the throng;\nEach tongue the liberal words of praise repaid,\nOn every cheek a smile applauding play'd;\nThe rival Bard advanced, he struck the string,\nAnd pour'd the loftier song to Persia's King.\n\nWhy should the wearying cares of state\nOppress the Monarch with their weight?\nAlike to him if Peace shall bless\nThe multitude with happiness;\nAlike to him if frenzied War\nCareers triumphant on the embattled plain,\nAnd rolling on o'er myriads slain,\nWith gore and wounds shall clog his scythed car.\nWhat tho' the tempest rage! no sound\nOf the deep thunder shakes his distant throne,\nAnd the red flash that spreads destruction round,\nReflects a glorious splendour on the Crown.\n\nWhere is the Man who with ennobling pride\nBeholds not his own nature? where is he\nWho but with deep amazement awe allied\nMust muse the mysteries of the human mind,\nThe miniature of Deity.\nFor Man the vernal clouds descending\nShower down their fertilizing rain,\nFor Man the ripen'd harvest bending\nWaves with soft murmur o'er the plenteous plain.\nHe spreads the sail on high,\nThe rude gale wafts him o'er the main;\nFor him the winds of Heaven subservient blow,\nEarth teems for him, for him the waters flow,\nHe thinks, and wills, and acts, a Deity below!\n\nWhere is the King who with elating pride\nSees not this Man--this godlike Man his Slave?\nMean are the mighty by the Monarch's side,\nAlike the wife, alike the brave\nWith timid step and pale, advance,\nAnd tremble at the royal glance;\nSuspended millions watch his breath\nWhose smile is happiness, whose frown is death.\n\nWhy goes the Peasant from that little cot,\nWhere PEACE and LOVE have blest his humble life?\nIn vain his agonizing wife\nWith tears bedews her husband's face,\nAnd clasps him in a long and last embrace;\nIn vain his children round his bosom creep,\nAnd weep to see their mother weep,\nFettering their father with their little arms;\nWhat are to him the wars alarms?\nWhat are to him the distant foes?\nHe at the earliest dawn of day\nTo daily labor went his way;\nAnd when he saw the sun decline,\nHe sat in peace beneath his vine:--\nThe king commands,

foes.\nIn vain at that tremendous hour,\nClasp'd in the savage soldier's reeking arms,\nShrieks to tame Heaven the violated Maid.\nBy the rude hand of Ruin scatter'd round\nTheir moss-grown towers shall spread the desart ground.\nLow shall the mouldering palace lie,\nAmid the princely halls the grass wave high,\nAnd thro' the shatter'd roof descend the inclement sky.\n\nGay o'er the embattled plain\nMoves yonder warrior train,\nTheir banners wanton on the morning gale!\nFull on their bucklers beams the rising ray,\nTheir glittering helmets flash a brighter day,\nThe shout of war rings echoing o'er the vale:\nFar reaches as the aching eye can strain\nThe splendid horror of their wide array.\nAh! not in vain expectant, o'er\nTheir glorious pomp the Vultures soar!\nAmid the Conqueror's palace high\nShall sound the song of victory:\nLong after journeying o'er the plain\nThe Traveller shall with startled eye\nSee their white bones then blanched by many a winter sky.\n\nLord of the Earth! we will not raise\nThe Temple to thy bounded praise.\nFor thee no victim need expire,\nFor thee no altar blaze with hallowed fire!\nThe burning city flames for thee--\nThine altar is the field of victory!\nThy sacred Majesty to bless\nMan a self-offer'd victim freely flies;\nTo thee he sacrifices Happiness,\nAnd Peace, and Love's endearing ties,\nTo thee a Slave he lives, to thee a Slave he dies.\n\n\nHusht was the lute, the Hebrew ceas'd to sing;\nThe shout rush'd forth--for ever live the King!\nLoud was the uproar, as when Rome's decree\nPronounc'd Achaia once again

rose;\nTheir thundering clamors burst the astonish'd sky,\nAnd birds o'erpassing hear, and drop, and die.\nThus o'er the Persian dome their plaudits ring,\nAnd the high hall re-echoed--live the

quick-retreating glance?\nThat crested head in war tower'd high,\nNo backward glance disgrac'd that eye,\nNo flushing fear that cheek o'erspread\nWhen stern he strode o'er heaps of dead;\nStrange tumult now his bosom moves--\nThe Warrior fears because he loves.\n\nWhy does the Youth delight to rove\nAmid the dark and lonely grove?\nWhy in the throng where all are gay,\nHis wandering eye with meaning fraught,\nSits he alone in silent thought?\nSilent he sits; for far away\nHis passion'd soul delights to stray;\nRecluse he roves and strives to shun\nAll human-kind because he loves but One!\n\nYes, King of Persia, thou art blest;\nBut not because the sparkling bowl\nTo rapture lifts thy waken'd soul\nBut not because of Power possest,\nNot that the Nations dread thy nod,\nAnd Princes reverence thee their earthly God,\nEven on a Monarch's solitude\nCare the black Spectre will intrude,\nThe bowl brief pleasure can bestow,\nThe Purple cannot shield from Woe.\nBut King of Persia thou art blest,\nFor Heaven who rais'd thee thus the world above\nHas made thee happy in Apame's love!\n\nOh! I have seen his fond looks trace\nEach angel feature of her face,\nRove o'er her form with eager eye,\nAnd sigh and gaze, and gaze and sigh.\nLo! from his brow with mimic frown,\nApame takes the sacred crown;\nHer faultless form, her lovely face\nAdd to the diadem new grace\nAnd subject to a Woman's laws\nDarius sees and smiles applause!\n\nHe ceas'd, and silent still remain'd the throng\nWhilst rapt attention own'd the power of song.\nThen loud as when the wintry whirlwinds blow\nFrom ev'ry voice the thundering plaudits flow;\nDarius smil'd, Apame's sparkling eyes\nGlanc'd on the King, and Woman won the prize.\n\nNow silent sat the expectant crowd, alone\nThe victor Hebrew gaz'd not on the throne;\nWith deeper hue his cheek distemper'd glows,\nWith statelier stature, loftier now he rose;\nHeavenward he gaz'd, regardless of the throng,\nAnd pour'd with awful voice sublimer song.\n\nAncient of Days! Eternal Truth! one hymn\nOne holier strain the Bard shall raise to thee,\nThee Powerful! Thee Benevolent! Thee Just!\nFriend! Father! All in All! the Vines rich blood,\nThe Monarch's might, and Woman's conquering charms,--\nThese shall we praise alone?

God of Truth!\nAll-Just! All-Mighty! I should ill deserve\nThy noblest gift, the gift divine of song,\nIf, so content with ear-deep melodies\nTo please all profitless, I did not pour\nSeverer strains; of Truth--eternal Truth,\nUnchanging Justice, universal Love.\nSuch strains awake the soul to loftiest thoughts,\nSuch strains the Blessed Spirits of the Good\nWaft, grateful incense, to the Halls of Heaven.\n\nThe dying notes still murmur'd on the string,\nWhen from his throne arose the raptur'd King.\nAbout to speak he stood, and wav'd his hand,\nAnd all expectant sat the obedient band.\n\nThen just and gen'rous, thus the Monarch cries,\n\"Be thine Zorobabel the well earned prize.\n\"The purple robe of state thy form shall fold,\n\"The beverage sparkle in thy cup of gold;\n\"The golden couch, the car, and honor'd chain,\n\"Requite the merits of thy favor'd strain,\n\"And rais'd supreme the ennobled race among\n\"Be call'd MY COUSIN for the victor song.\n\"Nor these alone the victor song shall bless,\n\"Ask what thou wilt, and what thou wilt, possess.\"\n\"Fall'n is Jerusalem!\" the Hebrew cries.\nAnd patriot anguish fills his streaming eyes,\n\"Hurl'd to the earth by Rapine's vengeful rod,\n\"Polluted lies the temple of our God,\n\"Far in a foreign land her sons remain,\n\"Hear the keen taunt, and drag the captive chain:\n\"In fruitless woe they wear the wearying years,\n\"And steep the bread of bitterness in tears.\n\"O Monarch, greatest, mildest, best of men,\n\"Restore us to those ruin'd walls again!\n\"Allow our race to rear that sacred dome,\n\"To live in liberty, and die at Home.\"\n\nSo spake Zorobabel--thus Woman's praise\nAvail'd again Jerusalem to raise,\nCall'd forth the sanction of the Despot's nod,\nAnd freed the Nation best belov'd of God.","title":"The Triumph Of Woman"},{"lines":"Author Note: In Finland there is a Castle which is called the New Rock, moated about with a river of unfounded depth, the water black and the fish therein\nvery distateful to the palate.

walls\nAlong the river stroll'd,\nAs ruffling o'er the pleasant stream\nThe evening gales came cold.\n\nSo as they stray'd a swan they saw\nSail stately up and strong,\nAnd by a silver chain she drew\nA little boat along,\n\nWhose streamer to the gentle breeze\nLong floating fluttered light,\nBeneath whose crimson canopy\nThere lay reclin'd a knight.\n\nWith arching crest and swelling breast\nOn sail'd the stately swan\nAnd lightly up the parting tide\nThe little boat came on.\n\nAnd onward to the shore they drew\nAnd leapt to land the knight,\nAnd down the stream the swan-drawn boat\nFell soon beyond the sight.\n\nWas never a Maid in Waldhurst's walls\nMight match with Margaret,\nHer cheek was fair, her eyes were dark,\nHer silken locks like jet.\n\nAnd many a rich and noble youth\nHad strove to win the fair,\nBut never a rich or noble youth\nCould rival Rudiger.\n\nAt every tilt and turney he\nStill bore away the prize,\nFor knightly feats superior still\nAnd knightly courtesies.\n\nHis gallant feats, his looks, his love,\nSoon won the willing fair,\nAnd soon did Margaret become\nThe wife of Rudiger.\n\nLike morning dreams of happiness\nFast roll'd the months away,\nFor he was kind and she was kind\nAnd who so blest as they?\n\nYet Rudiger would sometimes sit\nAbsorb'd in silent thought\nAnd his dark downward eye would seem\nWith anxious meaning fraught;\n\nBut soon he rais'd his looks again\nAnd smil'd his cares eway,\nAnd mid the hall of gaiety\nWas none like him so gay.\n\nAnd onward roll'd the waining months,\nThe hour appointed came,\nAnd Margaret her Rudiger\nHail'd with a father's name.\n\nBut silently did Rudiger\nThe little infant see,\nAnd darkly on the babe he gaz'd\nAnd very sad was he.\n\nAnd when to bless the little babe\nThe holy Father came,\nTo cleanse the stains of sin away\nIn Christ's redeeming name,\n\nThen did the cheek of Rudiger\nAssume a death-pale hue,\nAnd on his clammy forehead stood\nThe cold convulsive dew;\n\nAnd faltering in his speech he bade\nThe Priest the rites delay,\nTill he could, to right health restor'd,\nEnjoy the festive day.\n\nWhen o'er the many-tinted sky\nHe saw the day decline,\nHe called upon his Margaret\nTo walk beside the Rhine.\n\n\"And we will take the little babe,\n\"For soft the breeze that blows,\n\"And the wild murmurs of the stream\n\"Will lull him to repose.\"\n\nSo forth together did they go,\nThe evening breeze was mild,\nAnd Rudiger upon his arm\nDid pillow the sweet child.\n\nAnd many a one from Waldhurst's walls\nAlong the banks did roam,\nBut soon the evening wind came cold,\nAnd all betook them home.\n\nYet Rudiger in silent mood\nAlong the banks would roam,\nNor aught could Margaret prevail\nTo turn his footsteps home.\n\n\"Oh turn thee--turn thee Rudiger,\n\"The rising mists behold,\n\"The evening wind is damp and chill,\n\"The little babe is cold!\"\n\n\"Now hush thee--hush thee Margaret,\n\"The mists will do no harm,\n\"And from the wind the little babe\n\"Lies sheltered on my arm.\"\n\n\"Oh turn thee--turn thee Rudiger,\n\"Why onward wilt thou roam?\n\"The moon is up, the night is cold,\n\"And we are far from home.\"\n\nHe answered not, for now he saw\nA Swan come sailing strong,\nAnd by a silver chain she drew\nA little boat along.\n\nTo shore they came, and to the boat\nFast leapt he with the child,\nAnd in leapt Margaret--breathless now\nAnd pale with fear and wild.\n\nWith arching crest and swelling breast\nOn sail'd the stately swan,\nAnd lightly down the rapid tide\nThe little boat went on.\n\nThe full-orb'd moon that beam'd around\nPale splendor thro' the night,\nCast through the crimson canopy\nA dim-discoloured light.\n\nAnd swiftly down the hurrying stream\nIn silence still they sail,\nAnd the long streamer fluttering fast\nFlapp'd to the heavy gale.\n\nAnd he was mute in sullen thought\nAnd she was mute with fear,\nNor sound but of the parting tide\nBroke on the listening ear.\n\nThe little babe began to cry\nAnd waked his mother's care,\n\"Now give to me the little babe\n\"For God's sake, Rudiger!\"\n\n\"Now hush thee, hush thee Margaret!\n\"Nor my poor heart distress--\n\"I do but pay perforce the price\n\"Of former happiness.\n\n\"And hush thee too my little babe,\n\"Thy cries so feeble cease:\n\"Lie still, lie still;--a little while\n\"And thou shalt be at peace.\"\n\nSo as he spake to land they drew,\nAnd swift he stept on shore,\nAnd him behind did Margaret\nClose follow evermore.\n\nIt was a place all desolate,\nNor house nor tree was there,\nAnd there a rocky mountain rose\nBarren, and bleak, and bare.\n\nAnd at its base a cavern yawn'd,\nNo eye its depth might view,\nFor in the moon-beam shining round\nThat darkness darker grew.\n\nCold Horror crept thro' Margaret's blood,\nHer heart it paus'd with fear,\nWhen Rudiger approach'd the cave\nAnd cried, \"lo I am here!\"\n\nA deep sepulchral sound the cave\nReturn'd \"lo I am here!\"\nAnd black from out the cavern gloom\nTwo giant arms appear.\n\nAnd Rudiger approach'd and held\nThe little infant nigh;\nThen Margaret shriek'd, and gather'd then\nNew powers from agony.\n\nAnd round the baby fast and firm\nHer trembling arms she folds,\nAnd with a strong convulsive grasp\nThe little infant holds.\n\n\"Now help me, Jesus!\" loud she cries.\nAnd loud on God she calls;\nThen from the grasp of Rudiger\nThe little infant falls.\n\nAnd now he shriek'd, for now his frame\nThe huge black arms clasp'd round,\nAnd dragg'd the wretched Rudiger\nAdown the dark

poor Caledonia's mountaineer,\nThat wants stern edict e'er, and feudal grief,\nHad forced him from a home he loved so dear!\nYet found he here a home and glad relief,\nAnd plied the beverage from his own fair sheaf,\nThat fired his Highland blood with mickle glee:\nAnd England sent her men, of men the chief,\nWho taught those sires of empire yet to be,\nTo plant the tree of life,--to plant fair Freedom's tree!\n\nHere was not mingled in the city's pomp\nOf life's extremes the grandeur and the gloom\nJudgment awoke not here her dismal tromp,\nNor seal'd in blood a fellow-creature's doom,\nNor mourn'd the captive in a living tomb.\nOne venerable man, beloved of all,\nSufficed, where innocence was yet in bloom,\nTo sway the strife, that seldom might befall:\nAnd Albert was their judge, in patriarchal hall.\n\nHow reverend was the look, serenely aged,\nHe bore, this gentle Pennsylvanian sire,\nWhere all but kindly fervors were assuaged,\nUndimm'd by weakness' shade, or turbid ire!\nAnd though, amidst the calm of thought entire,\nSome high and haughty features might betray\nA soul impetuous once, 'twas earthly fire\nThat fled composure's intellectual ray,\nAs AEtna's fires grow dim before the rising day.\n\nI boast no song in magic wonders rife,\nBut yet, oh Nature! is there naught to prize,\nFamiliar in thy bosom scenes of life?\nAnd dwells in day-light truth's salubrious skies\nNo form with which the soul may sympathise?--\nYoung, innocent, on whose sweet forehead mild\nThe parted ringlet shone in simplest guise,\nAn inmate in the home of Albert smiled,\nOr blest his noonday walk--she was his only child.\n\nThe rose of England bloom'd on Gertrude's cheek--\nWhat though these shades had seen her birth, her sire\nA Briton's independence taught to seek\nFar western worlds; and there his household fire\nThe light of social love did long inspire,\nAnd many a halcyon day he lived to see\nUnbroken but by one misfortune dire,\nWhen fate had reft his mutual heart--but she\nWas gone--and Gertrude climb'd a widow'd father's knee.\n\nA loved bequest,--and I may half impart--\nTo them that feel the strong paternal tie,\nHow like a new existence to his heart\nThat living flower uprose beneath his eye\nDear as she was from cherub infancy,\nFrom hours when she would round his garden play,\nTo time when as the ripening years went by,\nHer lovely mind could culture well repay,\nAnd more engaging grew, from pleasing day to day.\n\nI may not paint those thousand infant charms;\n(Unconscious fascination, undesign'd!)\nThe orison repeated in his arms,\nFor God to bless her sire and all mankind;\nThe book, the bosom on his knee reclined,\nOr how sweet fairy-lore he heard her con,\n(The playmate ere the teacher of her mind:)\nAll uncompanion'd else her heart had gone\nTill now, in Gertrude's eyes, their ninth blue summer shone.\n\nAnd summer was the tide, and sweet the hour,\nWhen sire and daughter saw, with fleet descent,\nAn Indian from his bark approach their bower,\nOf buskin limb, and swarthy lineament;\nThe red wild feathers on his brow were blent,\nAnd bracelets bound the arm that help'd to light\nA boy, who seem'd, as he beside him went,\nOf Christian vesture, and complexion bright,\nLed by his dusky guide, like morning brought by night.\n\nYet pensive seem'd the boy for one so young--\nThe dimple from his polish'd cheek had fled;\nWhen, leaning on his forest-bow unstrung,\nTh' Oneyda warrior to the planter said,\nAnd laid his hand upon the stripling's head,\n\"Peace be to thee! my words this belt approve;\nThe paths of peace my steps have hither led:\nThis little nursling, take him to thy love,\nAnd shield the bird unfledged, since gone the parent dove.\n\nChristian! I am the foeman of thy foe;\nOur wampum league thy brethren did embrace:\nUpon the Michigan, three moons ago,\nWe launch'd our pirogues for the bison chase,\nAnd with the Hurons planted for a space,\nWith true and faithful hands, the olive-stalk;\nBut snakes are in the bosoms of their race,\nAnd though they held with us a friendly talk,\nThe hollow peace-tree fell beneath their tomahawk!\n\nIt was encamping on the lake's far port,\nA cry of Areouski broke our sleep,\nWhere storm'd an ambush'd foe thy nation's fort\nAnd rapid, rapid whoops came o'er the deep;\nBut long thy country's war-sign on the steep\nAppear'd through ghastly intervals of light,\nAnd deathfully their thunders seem'd to sweep,\nTill utter darkness swallow'd up the sight,\nAs if a shower of blood had quench'd the fiery fight!\n\n\nIt slept--it rose again--on high their tower\nSprung upwards like a torch to light the skies,\nThen down again it rain'd an ember shower,\nAnd louder lamentations heard we rise;\nAs when the evil Manitou that dries\nTh' Ohio woods, consumes them in his ire,\nIn vain the desolated panther flies,\nAnd howls amidst his wilderness of fire:\nAlas! too late, we reach'd and smote those Hurons dire!\n\nBut as the fox beneath the nobler hound,\nSo died their warriors by our battle brand;\nAnd from the tree we, with her child, unbound\nA lonely mother of the Christian land:--\nHer lord--the captain of the British band--\nAmidst the slaughter of his soldiers lay.\nScarce knew the widow our delivering hand;\nUpon her child she sobb'd and soon'd away,\nOr shriek'd unto the God to whom the Christians pray.\n\nOur virgins fed her with their kindly bowls\nOf fever-balm and sweet sagamite:\nBut she was journeying to the land of souls,\nAnd lifted up her dying head to pray\nThat we should bid an ancient friend convey\nHer orphan to his home of England's shore;\nAnd take, she said, this token far away,\nTo one that will remember us of yore,\nWhen he beholds the ring that Waldegrave's Julia wore.\n\nAnd I, the eagle of my tribe, have rush'd\nWith this lorn dove.\"--A sage's self-command\nHad quell'd the tears from Albert's heart that gush'd;\nBut yet his cheek--his agitated hand--\nThat shower'd upon the stranger of the land\nNo common boon, in grief but ill beguiled\nA soul that was not wont to be unmann'd;\n\"And stay,\" he cried, \"dear pilgrim of the wild,\nPreserver of my old, my boon companion's child!--\n\nChild of a race whose name my bosom warms,\nOn earth's remotest bounds how welcome here!\nWhose mother oft, a child, has fill'd these arms,\nYoung as thyself, and innocently dear,\nWhose grandsire was my early life's compeer.\nAh, happiest home of England's happy clime!\nHow beautiful even' now thy scenes appear,\nAs in the noon and sunshine of my prime!\nHow gone like yesterday these thrice ten years of time!\n\nAnd Julia! when thou wert like Gertrude now\nCan I forget thee, favorite child of yore?\nOr thought I, in thy father's house, when thou\nWert lightest-hearted on his festive floor,\nAnd first of all his hospitable door\nTo meet and kiss me at my journey's end?\nBut where was I when Waldegrave was no more?\nAnd thou didst pale thy gentle head extend\nIn woes, that ev'n the tribe of deserts was thy friend!\"\n\nHe said--and strain'd unto his heart the boy;--\nFar differently, the mute Oneyda took\nHis calumet of peace, and cup of joy;\nAs monumental bronze unchanged his look;\nA soul that pity touch'd but never shook;\nTrain'd from his tree-rock'd cradle to his bier\nThe fierce extreme of good and ill to brook\nImpassive--fearing but the shame of fear--\nA stoic of the woods--a man without a tear.\n\nYet deem not goodness on the savage stock\nOf Outalissi's heart disdain'd to grow;\nAs lives the oak unwither'd on the rock\nBy storms above, and barrenness below;\nHe scorn'd his own, who felt another's wo:\nAnd ere the wolf-skin on his back he flung,\nOr laced his mocassins, in act to go,\nA song of parting to the boy he sung,\nWho slept on Albert's couch, nor heard his friendly tongue.\n\n\"Sleep, wearied one! and in the dreaming land\nShouldst thou to-morrow with thy mother meet,\nOh! tell her spirit, that the white man's hand\nHath pluck'd the thorns of sorrow from thy feet;\nWhile I in lonely wilderness shall greet\nThey little foot-prints--or by traces know\nThe fountain, where at noon I thought it sweet\nTo feed thee with the quarry of my bow,\nAnd pour'd the lotus-horn, or slew the mountain roe.\n\nAdieu! sweet scion of the rising sun!\nBut should affliction's storms thy blossom mock,\nThen come again--my own adopted one!\nAnd I will graft thee on a noble stock:\nThe crocodile, the condor of the rock,\nShall be the pastime of thy sylvan wars;\nAnd I will teach thee in the battle' shock\nTo pay with Huron blood thy father's scars,\nAnd gratulate his soul rejoicing in the stars!\"\n\nSo finish'd he the rhyme (howe'er uncouth)\nThat true to nature's fervid feelings ran;\n(And song is but the eloquence of truth:)\nThen forth uprose that lone wayfaring man;\nBut dauntless he, nor chart, nor journey's plan\nIn woods required, whose trained eye was keen,\nAs eagle of the wilderness, to scan\nHis path by mountain, swamp, or deep ravine,\nOr ken far friendly huts on good savannas green.\n\nOld Albert saw him from the valley's side--\nHis pirogue launch'd--his pilgrimage begun--\nFar, like the red-bird's wing he seem'd to glide;\nThen dived, and vanish'd in the woodlands dun.\nOft, to that spot by tender memory won,\nWould Albert climb the promontory's height,\nIf but a dim sail glimmer'd in the sun;\nBut never more to bless his longing sight,\nWas Outalissi hail'd, with bark and plumage bright.\n\n\nPART II.\n\nA valley from the river shower withdrawn\nWas Albert's home, two quiet woods between,\nWhose lofty verdure overlook'd his lawn\nAnd waters to their resting-place serene\nCame freshening, and reflecting all the scene:\n(A mirror in the depth of flowery shelves;)\nSo sweet a spot of earth, you might (I ween,)\nHave guess'd some congregation of the elves,\nTo sport by summer moons, had shaped it for themselves.\n\nYet wanted not the eye far scope to muse,\nNor vistas open'd by the wandering stream;\nBoth where at evening Alleghany views\nThrough ridges burning in her western beam\nLake after lake interminably gleam:\nAnd past those settlers' haunts the eye might roam\nWhere earth's unliving silence all would seem;\nSave where on rocks the beaver built his dome,\nOr buffalo remote low'd far from human home.\n\nBut silent not that adverse eastern path,\nWhich saw Aurora's hills th' horizon crown;\nThere was the river heard, in bed of wrath,\n(A precipice of foam from mountains brown,)\nLike tumults heard from some far distant town;\nBut softening in approach he left his gloom,\nAnd murmur'd pleasantly, and laid him down\nTo kiss those easy curving banks of bloom,\nThat lent the windward air an exquisite perfume.\n\nIt seem'd as if those scenes sweet influence had\nOn Gertrude's soul, and kindness like their own\nInspired those eyes affectionate and glad,\nThat seem'd to love whate'er they look'd upon;\nWhether with Hebe's mirth her features shone,\nOr if a shade more pleasing them o'ercast,\n(As if for heavenly musing meant alone;)\nYet so becomingly th' expression past,\nThat each succeeding look was lovelier than the last.\n\nNor guess I, was that Pennsylvanian home,\nWith all its picturesque and balmy grace,\nAnd fields that were a luxury to roam,\nLost on the soul that look'd from such a face!\nEnthusiast of the woods! when years apace\nHad bound thy lovely waist with woman's zone,\nThe sunrise path, at morn, I see thee trace\nTo hills with high magnolia overgrown,\nAnd joy to breathe the groves, romantic and alone.\n\nThe sunrise drew her thoughts to Europe forth,\nThat thus apostrophised its viewless scene:\n\"Land of my father's love, my mother's birth!\nThe home of kindred I have never seen!\nWe know not other--oceans are between:\nYet say, far friendly hearts! from whence we came,\nOf us does oft remembrance intervene?\nMy mother sure--my sire a thought may claim;--\nBut Gertrude is to you an unregarded name.\n\nAnd yet, loved England! when thy name I trace\nIn many a pilgrim's tale and poet's song,\nHow can I choose but wish for one embrace\nOf them, the dear unknown, to whom belong\nMy mother's looks; perhaps her likeness strong?\nOh, parent! with what reverential awe,\nFrom features of thine own related throng,\nAn image of thy face my soul could draw!\nAnd see thee once again whom I too shortly saw!\"\n\nYet deem not Gertrude sighed for foreign joy;\nTo soothe a father's couch her only care,\nAnd keep his reverend head from all annoy:\nFor this, methinks, her homeward steps repair,\nSoon as the morning wreath had bound her hair;\nWhile yet the wild deer trod in spangling dew,\nWhile boatmen carol'd to the fresh-blown air,\nAnd woods a horizontal shadow threw,\nAnd early fox appear'd in momentary view.\n\nApart there was a deep untrodden grot,\nWhere oft the reading hours sweet Gertrude wore,\nTradition had not named its lonely spot;\nBut here (methinks) might India's sons explore\nTheir fathers' dust, or lift, perchance of yore,\nTheir voice to the great Spirit:--rocks sublime\nTo human art a sportive semblance bore,\nAnd yellow lichens color'd all the clime,\nLike moonlight battlements, and towers decay'd by time.\n\nBut high in amphitheatre above,\nGay tinted woods their massy foliage threw:\nBreathed but an air of heaven, and all the grove\nAs if instinct with living spirit grew,\nRolling its verdant gulfs of every hue;\nAnd now suspended was the pleasing din,\nNow from a murmur faint it swell'd anew,\nLike the first note of organ heard within\nCathedral aisles,--ere yet its symphony begin.\n\nIt was in this lonely valley she would charm\nThe lingering noon, where flowers a couch had strown;\nHer cheek reclining, and her snowy arm\nOn hillock by the pine-tree half o'ergrown:\nAnd aye that volume on her lap is thrown,\nWhich every heart of human mould endears;\nWith Shakspear's self she speaks and smiles alone,\nAnd no intruding visitation fears,\nTo shame the unconscious laugh, or stop her sweetest tears.\n\nAnd naught within the grove was heard or seen\nBut stock-doves plaining through its gloom profound,\nOr winglet of the fairy humming-bird,\nLike atoms of the rainbow fluttering round;\nWhen, lo! there enter'd to its inmost ground\nA youth, the stranger of a distant land;\nHe was, to weet, for eastern mountains bound;\nBut late th' equator suns his cheek had tann'd,\nAnd California's gales his roving bosom fann'd.\n\nA steed, whose rein hung loosely o'er his arm,\nHe led dismounted; here his leisure pace,\nAmid the brown leaves, could her ear alarm,\nClose he had come, and worshipp'd for a space\nThose downcast features:--she her lovely face\nUplift on one, whose lineaments and frame\nWore youth and manhood's intermingled grace:\nIberian seem'd his booth--his robe the same,\nAnd well the Spanish plume his lofty looks became.\n\nFor Albert's home he sought--her finger fair\nHas pointed where the father's mansion stood.\nReturning from the copse he soon was there;\nAnd soon has Gertrude hied from dark greenwood:\nNor joyless, by the converse, understood\nBetween the man of age and pilgrim young,\nThat gay congeneality of mood,\nAnd early liking from acquaintance sprung;\nFull fluently conversed their guest in England's tongue.\n\nAnd well could he his pilgrimage of taste\nUnfold,--and much they loved his fervid strain,\nWhile he each fair variety retraced\nOf climes, and manners, o'er the eastern main.\nNow happy Switzer's hills,--romantic Spain,--\nGay lilied fields of France,--or, more refined,\nThe soft Ausonia's monumental reign;\nNor less each rural image he design'd\nThan all the city's pomp and home of humankind.\n\nAnon some wilder portraiture he draws;\nOf Nature's savage glories he would spea,--\nThe loneliness of earth at overawes,--\nWhere, resting by some tomb of old Cacique,\nThe lama-driver on Peruvia's peak\nNor living voice nor motion marks around;\nBut storks that to the boundless forest shriek,\nOr wild-cane arch high flung o'er gulf profound,\nThat fluctuates when the storms of El Dorado sound.\n\nPleased with his guest, the good man still would ply\nEach earnest question, and his converse court;\nBut Gertrude, as she eyed him, knew not why\nA strange and troubling wonder stopt her short.\n\"In England thou hast been,--and, by report,\nAn orphan's name (quoth Albert) may'st have known.\nSad tale!--when latest fell our frontier fort,--\nOne innocent--one soldier's child--alone\nWas spared, and brought to me, who loved him as my own.\n\nYoung Henry Waldegrave! three delightful years\nThese very walls his infants sports did see,\nBut most I loved him when his parting tears\nAlternately bedew'd my child and me:\nHis sorest parting, Gertrude, was from thee;\nNor half its grief his little heart could hold;\nBy kindred he was sent for o'er the sea,\nThey tore him from us when but twelve years old,\nAnd scarcely for his loss have I been yet consoled!\"\n\nHis face the wanderer hid--but could not hide\nA tear, a smile, upon his cheek that dwell;\n\"And speak! mysterious strange!\" (Gertrude cried)\n\"It is!--it is!--I knew--I knew him well;\n'Tis Waldegrave's self, of Waldegrave come to tell!\"\nA burst of joy the father's lips declare!\nBut Gertrude speechless on his bosom fell;\nAt once his open arms embraced the pair,\nWas never group more blest in this wide world of care.\n\n\"And will ye pardon then (replied the youth)\nYour Waldegrave's feign'd name, and false attire?\nI durst not in the neighborhood, in truth,\nThe very fortunes of your house inquire;\nLest one that knew me might some tidings dire\nImpart, and I my weakness all betray,\nFor had I lost my Gertrude and my sire\nI meant but o'er your tombs to weep a day,\nUnknown I meant to weep, unknown to pass away.\n\nBut here ye life, ye bloom,--in each dear face,\nThe changing hand of time I may not blame;\nFor there, it hath but shed more reverend grace,\nAnd here, of beauty perfected the frame:\nAnd well I know your hearts are still the same--\nThey could not change--ye look the very way,\nAs when an orphan first to you I came.\nAnd have ye heard of my poor guide, I pray?\nNay, wherefore weep ye, friends, on such a joyous day!\"\n\n\"And art thou here? or is it but a dream?\nAnd wilt thou, Waldegrave, wilt thou, leave us more!\"\n\"No, never! thou that yet dost lovelier seem\nThan aught on earth--than even thyself of yore--\nI will not part thee from thy father's shore;\nBut we shall cherish him with mutual arms,\nAnd hand in hand again the path explore\nWhich every ray of young remembrance warms,\nWhile thou shalt be my own, with all thy truth and charms!\"\n\nAt morn, as if beneath a galaxy\nOf over-arching groves in blossoms white,\nWhere all was odorous scent and harmony,\nAnd gladness to the heart, nerve, ear, and sight:\nThere, if, O gentle Love! I read aright\nThe utterance that seal'd thy sacred bond,\n'Twas listening to these accents of delight,\nShe hid upon his breast those eyes, beyond\nExpression's power to paint, all languishingly fond--\n\n\"Flower of my life, so lovely, and so lone!\nWhom I would rather in this desert meet,\nScorning, and scorn'd by fortune's power, than own\nHer pomp and splendors lavish'd at my feet!\nTurn not from me thy breath, move exquisite\nThan odors cast on heaven's own shrine--to please--\nGive me thy love, than luxury more sweet,\nAnd more than all the wealth that loads the breeze,\nWhen Coromandel's ships return from Indian seas.\"\n\nThen would that home admit them--happier far\nThan grandeur's most magnificent saloon,\nWhile, here and there, a solitary star\nFlush'd in the darkening firmament of June;\nAnd silence brought the soul-felt hour, full soon\nIneffable, which I may not portray;\nFor never did the hymenean moon\nA paradise of hearts more sacred sway,\nIn all that slept beneath her soft voluptuous ray.\n\n\nPART III.\n\nO Love!

amidst the grove\nAnd pastoral savannas they consume!\nWhile she, beside her buskin'd youth to rove,\nDelights, in fancifully wild costume,\nHer lovely brow to shade with Indian plume;\nAnd forth in hunter-seeming vest they fare;\nBut not to chase the deer in forest gloom,\n'Tis but the breath of heaven--the blessed air--\nAnd interchange of hearts unknown, unseen to share.\n\nWhat though the sportive dog oft round them note,\nOr fawn, or wild bird bursting on the wing;\nYet who, in Love's own presence, would devote\nTo death those gentle throats that wake the spring,\nOr writhing from the brook its victim bring?\nNo!--nor let fear one little warbler rouse;\nBut, fed by Gertrude's hand, still let them sing,\nAcquaintance of her path, amidst the boughs,\nThat shade ev'n now her love, and witness'd first her vows.\n\nNow labyrinths, which but themselves can pierce,\nMethinks, conduct them to some pleasant ground,\nWhere welcome hills shut out the universe,\nAnd pines their lawny walk encompass round;\nThere, if a pause delicious converse found,\n'Twas but when o'er each heart th' idea stole,\n(Perchance a while in joy's oblivion drown'd)\nThat come what may, while life's glad pulses roll,\nIndissolubly thus should soul be knit to soul.\n\nAnd in the visions of romantic youth,\nWhat years of endless bliss are yet to flow!\nBut mortal pleasure, what art thou in truth?\nThe torrent's smoothness, ere it dash below!\nAnd must I change my song? and must I show,\nSweet Wyoming! the day when thou art doom'd,\nGuiltless, to mourn thy loveliest bowers laid low!\nWhen were of yesterday a garden bloom'd,\nDeath overspread his pall, and blackening ashes gloom'd!\n\nSad was the year, by proud oppression driven,\nWhen Transatlantic Liberty arose,\nNot in the sunshine and the smile of heaven,\nBut wrapt in whirlwinds, and begirt with woes,\nAmidst the strife of fratricidal foes;\nHer birth star was the light of burning plains;\nHer baptism is the weight of blood that flows\nFrom kindred hearts--the blood of British veins--\nAnd famine tracks her steps, and pestilential pains.\n\n\nYet, here the storm of death had raged remote,\nOr seige unseen in heaven reflects its beams,\nWho now each dreadful circumstance shall note,\nThat fills pale Gertrude's thoughts, and nightly dreams!\nDismal to her the forge of battle gleams\nPortentous light! and music's voice is dumb;\nSave where the fife its shrill reveille screams,\nOr midnight streets re-echo to the drum,\nThat speaks of maddening strife, and blood-stained fields to come.\n\nIt was in truth a momentary pang;\nYet how comprising myriad shapes of wo!\nFirst when in Gertrude's ear the summons rang,\nA husband to the battle doom'd to go!\n\"Nay meet not thou( she cried) thy kindred foe!\nBut peaceful let us seek fair England's strand!\"\n\"Ah, Gertrude, thy beloved heart, I know,\nWould feel like mine the stigmatising brand!\nCould I forsake the cause of Freedom's holy band!\n\nBut shame--but flight--a recreant's name to prove,\nTo hide in exile ignominous fears;\nSay, ev'n if this I brook'd, the public love\nThy father's bosom to his home endears:\nAnd how could I his few remaining years,\nMy Gertrude, sever from so dear a child?\"\nSo, day by day, her boding heart he cheers:\nAt last that heart to hope is half beguiled,\nAnd, pale, through tears suppress'd, the mournful beauty smiled.\n\nNight came,--and in their lighted bower, full late,\nThe joy of converse had endured--when, hark!\nAbrupt and loud, a summons shook their gate;\nAnd heedless of the dog's obstrep'rous bark,\nA form had rush'ed amidst them from the dark,\nAnd spread his arms,--and fell upon the floor:\nOf aged strength his limbs retained the mark;\nBut desolate he look's and famish'd, poor,\nAs ever shipwreck'd wretch lone left on desert shore.\n\nUprisen, each wond'ring brow is knit and arch'd:\nA spirit form the dead they deem him first:\nTo speak he tries; but quivering, pale, and parch'd,\nFrom lips, as by some powerless dream accursed\nEmotions unintelligible burst;\nAnd long his filmed eye is red and dim;\nAt length the pity-proffer'd cup his thirst\nHad half assuaged, and nerved his shuddering limb\nWhen Albert's hand he grasp'd;--but Albert knew not him--\n\n\"And hast thou then forgot,\" (he cried forlorn,\nAnd eyed the group with half indignant air,)\n\"Oh! hast thou, Christian chief, forgot the morn\nWhen I with thee the cup of peace did share?\nThen stately was this head, and dark this hair,\nThat now is white as Appalachia's snow;\nBut, if the weight of fifteen years' despair,\nAnd age hath bow'd me, and the torturing foe,\nBring me my boy--and he will his deliverer know!\"--\n\nIt was not long, with eyes and heart of flame,\nEre Henry to his loved Oneyda flew:\n\"Bless thee, my guide!\"--but backward as he came,\nThe chief his old bewilder'd head withdrew,\nAnd grasp'd his arm, and look'd and look'd him through.\n'Twas strange--nor could the group a smile control--\nThe long, the doubtful scrutiny to view:\nAt last delight o'er all his features stole,\n\"It is--my own,\" he cried, and clasp'd him to his soul.\n\n\"Yes! thou recallest my pride of years, for then\nThe bowstring of my spirit was not slack,\nWhen, spite of woods and floods, and ambush'd men,\nI bore thee like the quiver on my back,\nFleet as the whirlwind hurries on the rack;\nNor foreman then, nor cougar's crouch I fear'd,\nFor I was strong as mountain cataract:\nAnd dost thou not remember how we cheer'd,\nUpon the last hill-top, when white men's huts appear'd?\n\n\nThen welcome be my death-song, and my death\nSince I have seen thee, and again embrac'd.\"\nAnd longer had he spent his toil-worn breath;\nBut with affectionate and eager haste,\nWas every arm outstretch'd around their guest,\nTo welcome and to bless his aged head.\nSoon was the hospitable banquet placed;\nAnd Gertrude's lovely hands a balsam shed\nOn wounds with fever'd joy that more profusely bled.\n\n\"But this is not a time,\"--he started up,\nAnd smote his breast with wo-denouncing hand--\n\"This is no time to fill the joyous cup,\nThe Mammoth comes,--the foe,--the Monster Brandt,--\nWith all his howling desolating band;\nThese eyes have seen their blade and burning pine\nAwake at once, and silence half your land.\nRed is the cup they drink; but not with wine:\nAwake, and watch to-night, or see no morning shine!\n\nScorning to wield the hatchet for his bribe,\n'Gainst Brandt himself I went to battle forth:\nAccursed Brandt! he left of all my tribe\nNor man, nor child, nor thing of living birth:\nNo! not the dog that watch'd my household hearth,\nEscaped that night of blood, upon our plains!\nAll perish'd!--I alone am left on earth!\nTo whom nor relative nor blood remains.\nNo! not a kindred drop that runs in human veins!\n\nBut go!--and rouse your warriors, for, if right\nThese old bewilder'd eyes could guess, by signs\nOf striped, and starred banners, on yon height\nOf eastern cedars, o'er the creek of pines--\nSome fort embattled by your country shines:\nDeep roars th' innavigable gulf below\nIts squared rock, and palisaded lines.\nGo!

Schooled in guile\nFor ages, while each passing year had brought\nIts baneful lesson, they had filled the world\nWith their abominations; while its tribes,\nTrodden to earth, imbruted, and despoiled,\nHad knelt to them in worship; sacrifice\nHad smoked on many an altar, temple roofs\nHad echoed with the blasphemous prayer and hymn:\nBut thou, the great reformer of the world,\nTak'st off the sons of violence and fraud\nIn their green pupilage, their lore half learned--\nEre guilt has quite o'errun the simple heart\nGod gave them at their birth, and blotted out\nHis image. Thou dost mark them, flushed with hope,\nAs on the threshold of their vast designs\nDoubtful and loose they stand, and strik'st them down.\n\nAlas, I little thought that the stern power\nWhose fearful praise I sung, would try me thus\nBefore the strain was ended. It must cease--\nFor he is in his grave who taught my youth\nThe art of verse, and in the bud of life\nOffered me to the muses. Oh, cut off\nUntimely! when thy reason in its strength,\nRipened by years of toil and studious search\n\nAnd watch of Nature's silent lessons, taught\nThy hand to practise best the lenient art\nTo which thou gavest thy laborious days.\nAnd, last, thy life. And, therefore, when the earth\nReceived thee, tears were in unyielding eyes\nAnd on hard cheeks, and they who deemed thy skill\nDelayed their death-hour, shuddered and turned pale\nWhen thou wert gone. This faltering verse, which thou\nShalt not, as wont, o'erlook, is all I have\nTo offer at thy grave--this--and the hope\nTo copy thy example, and to leave\nA name of which the wretched shall not think\nAs of an enemy's, whom they forgive\nAs all forgive the dead. Rest, therefore, thou\nWhose early guidance trained my infant steps--\nRest, in the bosom of God, till the brief sleep\nOf death is over, and a happier life\nShall dawn to waken thine insensible dust.\nNow thou art not--and yet the men whose guilt\nHas wearied Heaven for vengeance--he who bears\nFalse witness--he who takes the orphan's bread,\nAnd robs the widow--he who spreads abroad\nPolluted hands in mockery of prayer,\nAre left to cumber earth. Shuddering I look\nOn what is written, yet I blot not out\nThe desultory numbers--let them stand.\nThe record of an idle revery.","title":"Hymn To Death"},{"lines":"The melancholy days are come, the

died,\nThe fair meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side.\nIn the cold moist earth we laid her, when the forests cast the leaf,\nAnd we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief:\nYet

but seldom bent,\nNow at the noontide nought had happed to slay,\nWithin a vale he called his hounds away,\nHearkening the echoes of his lone voice cling\nAbout the cliffs and through the beech-trees ring.\n\nBut when they ended, still awhile he stood,\nAnd but the sweet familiar thrush could hear,\nAnd all the day-long noises of the wood,\nAnd o'er the dry leaves of the vanished year\nHis hounds' feet pattering as they drew anear,\nAnd heavy breathing from their heads low hung,\nTo see the mighty corner bow unstrung.\n\nThen smiling did he turn to leave the place,\nBut with his first step some new fleeting thought\nA shadow cast across his sun-burnt face;\nI think the golden net that April brought\nFrom some warm world his wavering soul had caught;\nFor, sunk in vague sweet longing, did he go\nBetwixt the trees with doubtful steps and slow.\n\nYet howsoever slow he went, at last\nThe trees grew sparser, and the wood was done;\nWhereon one farewell backward look he cast,\nThen, turning round to see what place was won,\nWith shaded eyes looked underneath the sun,\nAnd o'er green meads and new-turned furrows brown\nBeheld the gleaming of King Schœneus' town.\n\nSo thitherward he turned, and on each side\nThe folk were busy on the teeming land,\nAnd man and maid from the brown furrows cried,\nOr midst the newly blossomed vines did stand,\nAnd as the rustic weapon pressed the hand\nThought of the nodding of the well-filled ear,\nOr how the knife the heavy bunch should shear.\n\nMerry it was: about him sung the birds,\nThe spring flowers bloomed along the firm dry road,\nThe sleek-skinned mothers of the sharp-horned herds\nNow for the barefoot milking-maidens lowed;\nWhile from the freshness of his blue abode,\nGlad his death-bearing arrows to forget,\nThe broad sun blazed, nor scattered plagues as yet.\n\nThrough such fair things unto the gates he came,\nAnd found them open, as though peace were there;\nWherethrough, unquestioned of his race or name,\nHe entered, and along the streets 'gan fare,\nWhich at the first of folk were well-nigh bare;\nBut pressing on, and going more hastily,\n\nMen hurrying too he 'gan at last to see.\nFollowing the last of these he still pressed on,\nUntil an open space he came unto,\nWhere wreaths of fame had oft been lost and won,\nFor feats of strength folks there were wont to do.\nAnd now our hunter looked for something new,\nBecause the whole wide space was bare, and stilled\nThe high seats were, with eager people filled.\n\nThere with the others to a seat he gat,\nWhence he beheld a broidered canopy,\n'Neath which in fair array King Schœneus sat\nUpon his throne with councillors thereby;\nAnd underneath his well-wrought seat and high,\nHe saw a golden image of the sun,\nA silver image of the Fleet-foot One.\n\nA brazen altar stood beneath their feet\nWhereon a thin flame flicker'd in the wind;\nNigh this a herald clad in raiment meet\nMade ready even now his horn to wind,\nBy whom a huge man held a sword, entwin'd\nWith yellow flowers; these stood a little space\nFrom off the altar, nigh the starting place.\n\nAnd there two runners did the sign abide,\nFoot set to foot,--a young man slim and fair,\nCrisp-hair'd, well knit, with firm limbs often tried\nIn places where no man his strength may spare:\nDainty his thin coat was, and on his hair.\nA golden circlet of renown he wore,\nAnd in his hand an olive garland bore.\n\nBut on this day with whom shall he contend?\nA maid stood by him like Diana clad\nWhen in the woods she lists her bow to bend,\nToo fair for one to look on and be glad,\nWho scarcely yet has thirty summers had,\nIf he must still behold her from afar;\nToo fair to let the world live free from war.\n\nShe seem'd all earthly matters to forget;\nOf all tormenting lines her face was clear;\nHer wide gray eyes upon the goal were set\nCalm and unmov'd as though no soul were near.\nBut her foe trembled as a man in fear,\nNor from her loveliness one moment turn'd\nHis anxious face with fierce desire that burn'd.\n\nNow through the hush there broke the trumpet's clang\nJust as the setting sun made eventide.\nThen from light feet a spurt of dust there sprang,\nAnd swiftly were they running side by side;\nBut silent did the thronging folk abide\nUntil the turning-post was reach'd at last,\nAnd round about it still abreast they passed.\n\nBut when the people saw how close they ran,\nWhen half-way to the starting-point they were,\nA cry of joy broke forth, whereat the man\nHeaded the white-foot runner, and drew near\nUnto the very end of all his fear;\nAnd scarce his straining feet the ground could feel,\nAnd bliss unhop'd for o'er his heart 'gan steal.\n\nBut 'midst the loud victorious shouts he heard\nHer footsteps drawing nearer, and the sound\nOf fluttering raiment, and thereat afeard\nHis flush'd and eager face he turn'd around,\nAnd even then he felt her past him bound\nFleet as the wind, but scarcely saw her there\nTill on the goal she laid her fingers fair.\n\nThere stood she breathing like a little child\nAmid some warlike clamour laid asleep,\nFor no victorious joy her red lips smil'd,\nHer cheek its wonted freshness did but keep;\nNo glance lit up her clear gray eyes and deep,\nThough some divine thought soften'd all her face\nAs once more rang the trumpet through the place.\n\nBut her late foe stopp'd short amidst his course,\nOne moment gaz'd upon her piteously.\nThen with a groan his lingering feet did force\nTo leave the spot whence he her eyes could see;\nAnd, changed like one who knows his time must be\nBut short and bitter, without any word\nHe knelt before the bearer of the sword;\n\nThen high rose up the gleaming deadly blade,\nBar'd of its flowers, and through the crowded place\nWas silence now, and midst of it the maid\nWent by the poor wretch at a gentle pace,\nAnd he to hers upturn'd his sad white face;\nNor did his eyes behold another sight\nEre on his soul there fell eternal light.\n\nSo was the pageant ended, and all folk\nTalking of this and that familiar thing\nIn little groups from that sad concourse broke,\nFor now the shrill bats were upon the wing,\nAnd soon dark night would slay the evening,\nAnd in dark gardens sang the nightingale\nHer little-heeded, oft-repeated tale.\n\nAnd with the last of all the hunter went,\nWho, wondering at the strange sight he had seen,\nPrayed an old man to tell him what it meant,\nBoth why the vanquished man so slain had been,\nAnd if the maiden were an earthly queen,\nOr rather what much more she seemed to be,\nNo sharer in this world's mortality.\n\n\"Stranger,\" said he, \"I pray she soon may die\nWhose lovely youth has slain so many an one!\nKing Schœneus' daughter is she verily,\nWho when her eyes first looked upon the sun\nWas fain to end her life but new begun,\nFor he had vowed to leave but men alone\nSprung from his loins when he from earth was gone.\n\n\"Therefore he bade one leave her in the wood,\nAnd let wild things deal with her as they might,\nBut this being done, some cruel god thought good\nTo save her beauty in the world's despite;\nFolk say that her, so delicate and white\nAs now she is, a rough root-grubbing bear\nAmidst her shapeless cubs at first did rear.\n\n\"In course of time the woodfolk slew her nurse,\nAnd to their rude abode the youngling brought,\nAnd reared her up to be a kingdom's curse;\nWho grown a woman, of no kingdom thought,\nBut armed and swift, 'mid beasts destruction wrought,\nNor spared two shaggy centaur kings to slay\nTo whom her body seemed an easy prey.\n\n\"So to this city, led by fate, she came\nWhom known by signs, whereof I cannot tell,\nKing Schœneus for his child at last did claim.\nNor otherwhere since that day doth she dwell\nSending too many a noble soul to hell--\nWhat! shine eyes glisten! what then, thinkest thou\nHer shining head unto the yoke to bow?\n\n\"Listen, my son, and love some other maid\nFor she the saffron gown will never wear,\nAnd on no flower-strewn couch shall she be laid,\nNor shall her voice make glad a lover's ear:\nYet if of Death thou hast not any fear,\nYea, rather, if thou lov'st her utterly,\nThou still may'st woo her ere thou com'st to die,\n\n\"Like him that on this day thou sawest lie dead;\nFor fearing as I deem the sea-born one;\nThe maid has vowed e'en such a man to wed\nAs in the course her swift feet can outrun,\nBut whoso fails herein, his days are done:\nHe came the nighest that was slain to-day,\nAlthough with him I deem she did but play.\n\n\"Behold, such mercy Atalanta gives\nTo those that long to win her loveliness;\nBe wise! be sure that many a maid there lives\nGentler than she, of beauty little less,\nWhose swimming eyes thy loving words shall bless,\nWhen in some garden, knee set close to knee,\nThou sing'st the song that love may teach to thee.\"\n\nSo to the hunter spake that ancient man,\nAnd left him for his own home presently:\nBut he turned round, and through the moonlight wan\nReached the thick wood, and there 'twixt tree and tree\nDistraught he passed the long night feverishly,\n'Twixt sleep and waking, and at dawn arose\nTo wage hot war against his speechless foes.\n\nThere to the hart's flank seemed his shaft to grow,\nAs panting down the broad green glades he flew,\nThere by his horn the Dryads well might know\nHis thrust against the bear's heart had been true,\nAnd there Adonis' bane his javelin slew,\nBut still in vain through rough and smooth he went,\nFor none the more his restlessness was spent.\n\nSo wandering, he to Argive cities came,\nAnd in the lists with valiant men he stood,\nAnd by great deeds he won him praise and fame,\nAnd heaps of wealth for little-valued blood;\nBut none of all these things, or life, seemed good\nUnto his heart, where still unsatisfied\nA ravenous longing warred with fear and pride.\n\nTherefore it happed when but a month had gone\nSince he had left King Schœneus' city old,\nIn hunting-gear again, again alone\nThe forest-bordered meads did he behold,\nWhere still mid thoughts of August's quivering gold\nFolk hoed the wheat, and clipped the vine in trust\nOf faint October's purple-foaming must.\n\nAnd once again he passed the peaceful gate,\nWhile to his beating heart his lips did lie,\nThat owning not victorious love and fate,\nSaid, half aloud, \"And here too must I try,\nTo win of alien men the mastery,\nAnd gather for my head fresh meed of fame\nAnd cast new glory on my father's name.\"\n\nIn spite of that, how beat his heart, when first\nFolk said to him, \"And art thou come to see\nThat which still makes our city's name accurst\nAmong all mothers for its cruelty?\nThen know indeed that fate is good to thee\nBecause to-morrow a new luckless one\nAgainst the white-foot maid is pledged to run.\"\n\nSo on the morrow with no curious eyes\nAs once he did, that piteous sight he saw,\nNor did that wonder in his heart arise\nAs toward the goal the conquering maid 'gan draw,\nNor did he gaze upon her eyes with awe,\nToo full the pain of longing filled his heart\nFor fear or wonder there to have a part.\n\nBut O, how long the night was ere it went!\nHow long it was before the dawn begun\nShowed to the wakening birds the sun's intent\nThat not in darkness should the world be done!\nAnd then, and then, how long before the sun\nBade silently the toilers of the earth\nGet forth to fruitless cares or empty mirth!\n\nAnd long it seemed that in the market-place\nHe stood and saw the chaffering folk go by,\nEre from the ivory throne King Schœneus' face\nLooked down upon the murmur royally,\nBut then came trembling that the time was nigh\nWhen he midst pitying looks his love must claim,\nAnd jeering voices must salute his name.\n\nBut as the throng he pierced to gain the throne,\nHis alien face distraught and anxious told\nWhat hopeless errand he was bound upon,\nAnd, each to each, folk whispered to behold\nHis godlike limbs; nay, and one woman old\nAs he went by must pluck him by the sleeve\nAnd pray him yet that wretched love to leave.\n\nFor sidling up she said, \"Canst thou live twice,\nFair son? canst thou have joyful youth again,\nThat thus thou goest to the sacrifice\nThyself the victim? nay then, all in vain\nThy mother bore her longing and her pain,\nAnd one more maiden on the earth must dwell\nHopeless of joy, nor fearing death and hell.\n\n\"O, fool, thou knowest not the compact then\nThat with the three-formed goddess she has made\nTo keep her from the loving lips of men,\nAnd in no saffron gown to be arrayed,\nAnd therewithal with glory to be paid,\nAnd love of her the moonlit river sees\nWhite 'gainst the shadow of the formless trees.\n\n\"Come back, and I myself will pray for thee\nUnto the sea-born framer of delights,\nTo give thee her who on the earth may be\nThe fairest stirrer up to death and fights,\nTo quench with hopeful days and joyous nights\nThe flame that doth thy youthful heart consume:\nCome back, nor give thy beauty to the tomb.\"\n\nHow should he listen to her earnest speech?\nWords, such as he not once or twice had said\nUnto himself, whose meaning scarce could reach\nThe firm abode of that sad hardihead--\nHe turned about, and through the marketstead\nSwiftly he passed, until before the throne\nIn the cleared space he stood at last alone.\n\nThen said the King, \"Stranger, what dost thou here?\nHave any of my folk done ill to thee?\nOr art thou of the forest men in fear?\nOr art thou of the sad fraternity\nWho still will strive my daughter's mates to be,\nStaking their lives to win an earthly bliss,\nThe lonely maid, the friend of Artemis?\"\n\n\"O King,\" he said, \"thou sayest the word indeed;\nNor will I quit the strife till I have won\nMy sweet delight, or death to end my need.\nAnd know that I am called Milanion,\nOf King Amphidamas the well-loved son:\nSo fear not that to thy old name, O King,\nMuch loss or shame my victory will bring.\"\n\n\"Nay, Prince,\" said Schœneus, \"welcome to this land\nThou wert indeed, if thou wert here to try\nThy strength 'gainst some one mighty of his hand;\nNor would we grudge thee well-won mastery.\nBut now, why wilt thou come to me to die,\nAnd at my door lay down thy luckless head,\nSwelling the band of the unhappy dead,\n\n\"Whose curses even now my heart doth fear?\nLo, I am old, and know what life can be,\nAnd what a bitter thing is death anear.\nO, Son! be wise, and harken unto me,\nAnd if no other can be dear to thee,\nAt least as now, yet is the world full wide,\nAnd bliss in seeming hopeless hearts may hide:\n\n\"But if thou losest life, then all is lost.\"\n\"Nay, King,\" Milanion said, \"thy words are vain.\nDoubt not that I have counted well the cost.\nBut say, on what day wilt thou that I gain\nFulfilled delight, or death to end my pain.\nRight glad were I if it could be to-day,\nAnd all my doubts at rest for ever lay.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said King Schœneus, \"thus it shall not be,\nBut rather shalt thou let a month go by,\nAnd weary with thy prayers for victory\nWhat god thou know'st the kindest and most nigh.\nSo doing, still perchance thou shalt not die:\nAnd with my goodwill wouldst thou have the maid,\nFor of the equal gods I grow afraid.\n\n\"And until then, O Prince, be thou my guest, .\nAnd all these troublous things awhile forget.\"\n\"Nay,\" said he, \"couldst thou give my soul good rest,\nAnd on mine head a sleepy garland set,\nThen had I 'scaped the meshes of the net,\nNor should thou hear from me another word;\nBut now, make sharp thy fearful heading-sword.\n\n\"Yet will I do what son of man may do,\nAnd promise all the gods may most desire,\nThat to myself I may at least be true;\nAnd on that day my heart and limbs so tire,\nWith utmost strain and measureless desire,\nThat, at the worst, I may but fall asleep\nWhen in the sunlight round that sword shall sweep. \"\n\nHe went therewith, nor anywhere would bide,\nBut unto Argos restlessly did wend;\nAnd there, as one who lays all hope aside,\nBecause the leech has said his life must end,\nSilent farewell he bade to foe and friend,\nAnd took his way unto the restless sea,\nFor there he deemed his rest and help might be.\n\nUpon the shore of Argolis there stands\nA temple to the goddess that he sought,\nThat, turned unto the lion-bearing lands,\nFenced from the east, of cold winds hath no thought,\nThough to no homestead there the sheaves are brought,\nNo groaning press torments the close-clipped murk,\nLonely the fane stands, far from all men's work.\n\nPass through a close, set thick with myrtle-trees,\nThrough the brass doors that guard the holy place,\nAnd entering, hear the washing of the seas\nThat twice a-day rise high above the base,\nAnd with the south-west urging them, embrace\nThe marble feet of her that standeth there\nThat shrink not, naked though they be and fair.\n\nSmall is the fane through which the sea-wind sings\nAbout Queen Venus' well-wrought image white,\nBut hung around are many precious things,\nThe gifts of those who, longing for delight,\nHave hung them there within the goddess' sight,\nAnd in return have taken at her hands\nThe living treasures of the Grecian lands.\n\nAnd thither now has come Milanion,\nAnd showed unto the priests' wide open eyes\nGifts fairer than all those that there have shone,\nSilk cloths, inwrought with Indian fantasies,\nAnd bowls inscribed with sayings of the wise\nAbove the deeds of foolish living things;\nAnd mirrors fit to be the gifts of kings.\n\nAnd now before the Sea-born One he stands,\nBy the sweet veiling smoke made dim and soft,\nAnd while the incense trickles from his hands,\nAnd while the odorous smoke-wreaths hang aloft,\nThus doth he pray to her: \"O Thou, who oft\nHast holpen man and maid in their distress\nDespise me not for this my wretchedness!\n\n\"O goddess, among us who dwelt below,\nKings and great men, great for a little while,\nHave pity on the lowly heads that bow,\nNor hate the hearts that love them without guile;\nWilt thou be worse than these, and is thy smile\nA vain device of him who set thee here,\nAn empty dream of some artificer?\n\n\"O great one, some men love, and are ashamed;\nSome men are weary of the bonds of love;\nYea, and by some men lightly art thou blamed,\nThat from thy toils their lives they cannot move,\nAnd 'mid the ranks of men their manhood prove.\nAlas! O goddess, if thou slayest me,\nWhat new immortal can I serve but thee?\n\n\"Think then, will it bring honour to thy head\nIf folk say, 'Everything aside he cast\nAnd to all fame and honour was he dead,\nAnd to his one hope now is dead at last,\nSince all unholpen he is gone and past;\nAh, the gods love not man, for certainly,\nHe to his helper did not cease to cry.'\n\n\"Nay, but thou wilt help; they who died before\nNot single-hearted as I deem came here,\nTherefore unthanked they laid their gifts before\nThy stainless feet, still shivering with their fear,\nLest in their eyes their true thought might appear,\nWho sought to be the lords of that fair town,\nDreaded of men and winners of renown.\n\n\"O Queen, thou knowest I pray not for this:\nO set us down together in some place\nWhere not a voice can break our heaven of bliss,\nWhere nought but rocks and I can see her face,\nSoftening beneath the marvel of thy grace,\nWhere not a foot our vanished steps can track--\nThe golden age, the golden age come back!\n\n\"O fairest, hear me now who do thy will,\nPlead for thy rebel that she be not slain,\nBut live and love and be thy servant still;\nAh, give her joy and take away my pain,\nAnd thus two long-enduring servants gain.\nAn easy thing this is to do for me,\nWhat need of my vain words to weary thee.\n\n\"But none the less, this place will I not leave\nUntil I needs must go my death to meet,\nOr at thy hands some happy sign receive\nThat in great joy we twain may one day greet\nThy presence here and kiss thy silver feet,\nSuch as we deem thee, fair beyond all words,\nVictorious o'er our servants and our lords.\"\n\nThen from the altar back a space he drew,\nBut from the Queen turned not his face away,\nBut 'gainst a pillar leaned, until the blue\nThat arched the sky, at ending of the day,\nWas turned to ruddy gold and changing gray,\nAnd clear, but low, the nigh-ebbed windless sea\nIn the still evening murmured ceaselessly.\n\nAnd there he stood when all the sun was down,\nNor had he moved, when the dim golden light,\nLike the fair lustre of a godlike town,\nHad left the world to seeming hopeless night,\nNor would he move the more when wan moonlight\nStreamed through the pillows for a little while,\nAnd lighted up the white Queen's changeless smile.\n\nNought noted he the shallow-flowing sea\nAs step by step it set the wrack a-swim;\nThe yellow torchlight nothing noted he\nWherein with fluttering gown and half-bared limb\nThe temple damsels sung their midnight hymn;\nAnd nought the doubled stillness of the fane\nWhen they were gone and all was hushed again.\n\nBut when the waves had touched the marble base,\nAnd steps the fish swim over twice a-day,\nThe dawn beheld him sunken in his place\nUpon the floor; and sleeping there he lay,\nNot heeding aught the little jets of spray\nThe roughened sea brought nigh, across him cast,\nFor as one dead all thought from him had passed.\n\nYet long before the sun had showed his head,\nLong ere the varied hangings on the wall\nHad gained once more their blue and green and red,\nHe rose as one some well-known sign doth call\nWhen war upon the city's gates doth fall,\nAnd scarce like one fresh risen out of sleep,\nHe 'gan again his broken watch to keep.\n\nThen he turned round; not for the sea-gull's cry\nThat wheeled above the temple in his flight,\nNot for the fresh south wind that lovingly\nBreathed on the new-born day and dying night,\nBut some strange hope 'twixt fear and great delight\nDrew round his face, now flushed, now pale and wan,\nAnd still constrained his eyes the sea to scan.\n\nNow a faint light lit up the southern sky,\nNot sun or moon, for all the world was gray,\nBut this a bright cloud seemed, that drew anigh,\nLighting the dull waves that beneath it lay\nAs toward the temple still it took its way,\nAnd still grew greater, till Milanion\nSaw nought for dazzling light that round him shone.\n\nBut as he staggered with his arms outspread,\nDelicious unnamed odours breathed around,\nFor languid happiness he bowed his head,\nAnd with wet eyes sank down upon the ground,\nNor wished for aught, nor any dream he found\nTo give him reason for that happiness,\nOr make him ask more knowledge of his bliss.\n\nAt last his eyes were cleared, and he could see\nThrough happy tears the goddess face to face\nWith that faint image of Divinity,\nWhose well-wrought smile and dainty changeless grace\nUntil that morn so gladdened all the place;\nThen, he unwitting cried aloud her name\nAnd covered up his eyes for fear and shame.\n\nBut through the stillness he her voice could hear\nPiercing his heart with joy scarce bearable,\nThat said, \"Milanion, wherefore dost thou fear,\nI am not hard to those who love me well;\nList to what I a second time will tell,\nAnd thou mayest hear perchance, and live to save\nThe cruel maiden from a loveless grave.\n\n\"See, by my feet three golden apples lie--\nSuch fruit among the heavy roses falls,\nSuch fruit my watchful damsels carefully\nStore up within the best loved of my walls,\nAncient Damascus, where the lover calls\nAbove my unseen head, and faint and light\nThe rose-leaves flutter round me in the night.\n\n\"And note, that these are not alone most fair\nWith heavenly gold, but longing strange they bring\nUnto the hearts of men, who will not care\nBeholding these, for any once-loved thing\nTill round the shining sides their fingers cling.\nAnd thou shalt see thy well-girt swift-foot maid\nBy sight of these amidst her glory stayed.\n\n\"For bearing these within a scrip with thee,\nWhen first she heads thee from the starting-place\nCast down the first one for her eyes to see,\nAnd when she turns aside make on apace,\nAnd if again she heads thee in the race\nSpare not the other two to cast aside\nIf she not long enough behind will bide.\n\n\"Farewell, and when has come the happy time\nThat she Diana's raiment must unbind\nAnd all the world seems blessed with Saturn's clime,\nAnd thou with eager arms about her twined\nBeholdest first her gray eyes growing kind,\nSurely, O trembler, thou shalt scarcely then\nForget the Helper of unhappy men.\"\n\nMilanion raised his head at this last word\nFor now so soft and kind she seemed to be\nNo longer of her Godhead was he feared;\nToo late he looked; for nothing could he see\nBut the white image glimmering doubtfully\nIn the departing twilight cold and gray,\nAnd those three apples on the step that lay.\n\nThese then he caught up quivering with delight,\nYet fearful lest it all might be a dream;\nAnd though aweary with the watchful night,\nAnd sleepless nights of longing, still did deem\nHe could not sleep; but yet the first sunbeam\nThat smote the fane across the heaving deep\nShone on him laid in calm, untroubled sleep.\n\nBut little ere the noontide did he rise,\nAnd why he felt so happy scarce could tell\nUntil the gleaming apples met his eyes.\nThen leaving the fair place where this befell\nOft he looked back as one who loved it well,\nThen homeward to the haunts of men, 'gan wend\nTo bring all things unto a happy end.\n\nNow has the lingering month at last gone by,\nAgain are all folk round the running place,\nNor other seems the dismal pageantry\nThan heretofore, but that another face\nLooks o'er the smooth course ready for the race,\nFor now, beheld of all, Milanion\nStands on the spot he twice has looked upon.\n\nBut yet--what change is this that holds the maid?\nDoes she indeed see in his glittering eye\nMore than disdain of the sharp shearing blade,\nSome happy hope of help and victory?\nThe others seem'd to say, \"We come to die;\nLook down upon us for a little while,\nThat, dead, we may bethink us of thy smile.\"\n\nBut he--what look of mastery was this\nHe cast on her? why were his lips so red;\nWhy was his face so flush'd with happiness?\nSo looks not one who deems himself but dead,\nE'en if to death he bows a willing head;\nSo rather looks a god well pleas'd to find\nSome earthly damsel fashion'd to his mind,\n\nWhy must she drop her lids before his gaze,\nAnd even as she casts adown her eyes\nRedden to note his eager glance of praise,\nAnd wish that she were clad in other guise?\nWhy must the memory to her heart arise\nOf things unnoticed when they first were heard,\nSome lover's song, some answering maiden's word?\n\nWhat makes these longings, vague--without a name,\nAnd this vain pity never felt before,\nThis sudden languor, this contempt of fame,\nThis tender sorrow for the time past o'er,\nThese doubts that grow each minute more and more?\nWhy does she tremble as the time grows near,\nAnd weak defeat and woeful victory fear?\n\nBut while she seem'd to hear her beating heart,\nAbove their heads the trumpet blast rang out\nAnd forth they sprang, and she must play her part;\nThen flew her white feet, knowing not a doubt,\nThough, slackening once, she turn'd her head about,\nBut then she cried aloud and faster fled\nThan e'er before, and all men deemed him dead.\n\nBut with no sound he raised aloft his hand,\nAnd thence what seemed a ray of light there flew\nAnd past the maid rolled on along the sand;\nThen trembling she her feet together drew\nAnd in her heart a strong desire there grew\nTo have the toy, some god she thought had given\nThat gift to her, to make of earth a heaven.\n\nThen from the course with eager steps she ran,\nAnd in her odorous bosom laid the gold.\nBut when she turned again, the great-limbed man,\nNow well ahead she failed not to behold,\nAnd mindful of her glory waxing cold,\nSprang up and followed him in hot pursuit,\nThough with one hand she touched the golden fruit.\n\nNote, too, the bow that she was wont to bear\nShe laid aside to grasp the glittering prize,\nAnd o'er her shoulder from the quiver fair\nThree arrows fell and lay before her eyes\nUnnoticed, as amidst the people's cries\nShe sprang to head the strong Milanion,\nWho now the turning-post had well-nigh won.\n\nBut as he set his mighty hand on it\nWhite fingers underneath his own were laid,\nAnd white limbs from his dazzled eyes did flit,\nThen he the second fruit cast by the maid:\nShe ran awhile, and then as one afraid\nWavered and stopped, and turned and made no stay,\nUntil the globe with its bright fellow lay.\n\nThen, as a troubled glance she cast around,\nNow far ahead the Argive could she see,\nAnd in her garment's hem one hand she wound\nTo keep the double prize, and strenuously\nSped o'er the course, and little doubt had she\nTo win the day, though now but scanty space\nWas left betwixt him and the winning place.\n\nShort was the way unto such wingèd feet,\nQuickly she gained upon him till at last\nHe turned about her eager eyes to meet\nAnd from his hand the third fair apple cast.\nShe wavered not, but turned and ran so fast\nAfter the prize that should her bliss fulfil,\nThat in her hand it lay ere it was still.\n\nNor did she rest, but turned about to win\nOnce more, an unblest woeful victory--\nAnd yet--and yet--why does her breath begin\nTo fail her, and her feet drag heavily?\nWhy fails she now to see if far or nigh\nThe goal is? why do her gray eyes grow dim?\nWhy do these tremors run through every limb?\n\nShe spreads her arms abroad some stay to find\nElse must she fall, indeed, and findeth this,\nA strong man's arms about her body twined.\nNor may she shudder now to feel his kiss,\nSo wrapped she is in new unbroken bliss:\nMade happy that the foe the prize hath won,\nShe weeps glad tears for all her glory done.\n\nShatter the trumpet, hew adown the posts!\nUpon the brazen altar break the sword,\nAnd scatter incense to appease the ghosts\nOf those who died here by their own award.\nBring forth the image of the mighty Lord,\nAnd her who unseen o'er the runners hung,\nAnd did a deed for ever to be sung.\n\nHere are the gathered folk; make no delay,\nOpen King Schœneus' well-filled treasury,\nBring out the gifts long hid from light of day,\nThe golden bowls o'erwrought with imagery,\nGold chains, and unguents brought from over sea,\nThe saffron gown the old Phœnician brought,\nWithin the temple of the Goddess wrought.\n\nO ye, O damsels, who shall never see\nHer, that Love's servant bringeth now to you,\nReturning from another victory,\nIn some cool bower do all that now is due!\nSince she in token of her service new\nShall give to Venus offerings rich enow,\nHer maiden zone, her arrows and her bow.","title":"Atalanta's Race"},{"lines":"But, learning now that they would have her speak,\nShe threw her wet hair backward from her brow,\nHer hand close to her mouth touching her cheek,\n\nAs though she had had there a shameful blow,\nAnd feeling it shameful to feel ought but shame\nAll through her heart, yet felt her cheek burned so,\n\nShe must a little touch it; like one lame\nShe walked away from Gauwaine, with her head\nStill lifted up; and on her cheek of flame\n\nThe tears dried quick; she stopped at last and said:\n\"O knights and lords, it seems but little skill\nTo talk of well-known things past now and dead.\n\n\"God wot I ought to say, I have done ill,\nAnd pray you all forgiveness heartily!\nBecause you must be right, such great lords--still\n\n\"Listen, suppose your time were come to die,\nAnd you were quite alone and very weak;\nYea, laid a dying while very mightily\n\n\"The wind was ruffling up the narrow streak\nOf river through your broad lands running well:\nSuppose a hush should come, then some one speak:\n\n\" 'One of these cloths is heaven, and one is hell,\nNow choose one cloth for ever; which they be,\nI will not tell you, you must somehow tell\n\n\" 'Of your own strength and mightiness; here, see!'\nYea, yea, my lord, and you to ope your eyes,\nAt foot of your familiar bed to see\n\n\"A great God's angel standing, with such dyes,\nNot known on earth, on his great wings, and hands\nHeld at two ways, light from the inner skies\n\n\"Showing him well, and making his commands\nSeem to be God's commands, moreover, too,\nHolding within his hands the cloths on wands;\n\n\"And one of these strange choosing cloths was blue,\nWavy and long, and one cut short and red;\nNo man could tell the better of the two.\n\n\"After a shivering half-hour you said:\n'God help! heaven's colour, the blue;' and he said: 'hell.'\nPerhaps you then would roll upon your bed,\n\n\"And cry to all good men that loved you well,\n'Ah Christ! if only I had known, known, known;'\nLauncelot went away, then I could tell,\n\n\"Like wisest man how all things would be, moan,\nAnd roll and hurt myself, and long to die,\nAnd yet fear much to die for what was sown.\n\n\"Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,\nWhatever may have happened through these years,\nGod knows I speak truth, saying that you lie.\"\n\nHer voice was low at first, being full of tears,\nBut as it cleared, it grew full loud and shrill,\nGrowing a windy shriek in all men's ears,\n\nA ringing in their startled brains, until\nShe said that Gauwaine lied, then her voice sunk,\nAnd her great eyes began again to fill,\n\nThough still she stood right up, and never shrunk,\nBut spoke on bravely, glorious lady fair!\nWhatever tears her full lips may have drunk,\n\nShe stood, and seemed to think, and wrung her hair,\nSpoke out at last with no more trace of shame,\nWith passionate twisting of her body there:\n\n\"It chanced upon a day that Launcelot came\nTo dwell at Arthur's court: at Christmas time\nThis happened; when the heralds sung his name,\n\n\" 'Son of King Ban of Benwick,' seemed to chime\nAlong with all the bells that rang that day,\nO'er the white roofs, with little change of rhyme.\n\n\"Christmas and whitened winter passed away,\nAnd over me the April sunshine came,\nMade very awful with black hail-clouds, yea\n\n\"And in the Summer I grew white with flame,\nAnd bowed my head down--Autumn, and the sick\nSure knowledge things would never be the same,\n\n\"However often Spring might be most thick\nOf blossoms and buds, smote on me, and I grew\nCareless of most things, let the clock tick, tick,\n\n\"To my unhappy pulse, that beat right through\nMy eager body; while I laughed out loud,\nAnd let my lips curl up at false or true,\n\n\"Seemed cold and shallow without any cloud.\nBehold my judges, then the cloths were brought;\nWhile I was dizzied thus, old thoughts would crowd,\n\n\"Belonging to the time ere I was bought\nBy Arthur's great name and his little love;\nMust I give up for ever then, I thought,\n\n\"That which I deemed would ever round me move\nGlorifying all things; for a little word,\nScarce ever meant at all, must I now prove\n\n\"Stone-cold for ever? Pray you, does the Lord\nWill that all folks should be quite happy and good?\nI love God now a little, if this cord\n\n\"Were broken, once for all what striving could\nMake me love anything in earth or heaven?\nSo day by day it grew, as if one should\n\n\"Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even,\nDown to a cool sea on a summer day;\nYet still in slipping there was some small leaven\n\n\"Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way,\nUntil one surely reached the sea at last,\nAnd felt strange new joy as the worn head lay\n\n\"Back, with the hair like sea-weed; yea all past\nSweat of the forehead, dryness of the lips,\nWashed utterly out by the dear waves o'ercast,\n\n\"In the lone sea, far off from any ships!\nDo I not know now of a day in Spring?\nNo minute of that wild day ever slips\n\n\"From out my memory; I hear thrushes sing,\nAnd wheresoever I may be, straightway\nThoughts of it all come up with most fresh sting:\n\n\"I was half mad with beauty on that day,\nAnd went without my ladies all alone,\nIn a quiet garden walled round every way;\n\n\"I was right joyful of that wall of stone,\nThat shut the flowers and trees up with the sky,\nAnd trebled all the beauty: to the bone,\n\n\"Yea right through to my heart, grown very shy\nWith weary thoughts, it pierced, and made me glad;\nExceedingly glad, and I knew verily,\n\n\"A little thing just then had made me mad;\nI dared not think, as I was wont to do,\nSometimes, upon my beauty; if I had\n\n\"Held out my long hand up against the blue,\nAnd, looking on the tenderly darken'd fingers,\nThought that by rights one ought to see quite through,\n\n\"There, see you, where the soft still light yet lingers,\nRound by the edges; what should I have done,\nIf this had joined with yellow spotted singers,\n\n\"And startling green drawn upward by the sun?\nBut shouting, loosed out, see now! all my hair,\nAnd trancedly stood watching the west wind run\n\n\"With faintest half-heard breathing sound--why there\nI lose my head e'en now in doing this;\nBut shortly listen--in that garden fair\n\n\"Came Launcelot walking; this is true, the kiss\nWherewith we kissed in meeting that spring day,\nI scarce dare talk of the remember'd bliss,\n\n\"When both our mouths went wandering in one way,\nAnd aching sorely, met among the leaves;\nOur hands being left behind strained far away.\n\n\"Never within a yard of my bright sleeves\nHad Launcelot come before--and now, so nigh!\nAfter that day why is it Guenevere grieves?\n\n\"Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,\nWhatever happened on through all those years,\nGod knows I speak truth, saying that you lie.\n\n\"Being such a lady could I weep these tears\nIf this were true? A great queen such as I\nHaving sinn'd this way, straight her conscience sears;\n\n\"And afterwards she liveth hatefully,\nSlaying and poisoning, certes never weeps,--\nGauwaine, be friends now, speak me lovingly.\n\n\"Do I not see how God's dear pity creeps\nAll through your frame, and trembles in your mouth?\nRemember in what grave your mother sleeps,\n\n\"Buried in some place far down in the south,\nMen are forgetting as I speak to you;\nBy her head sever'd in that awful drouth\n\n\"Of pity that drew Agravaine's fell blow,\nI pray your pity! let me not scream out\nFor ever after, when the shrill winds blow\n\n\"Through half your castle-locks! let me not shout\nFor ever after in the winter night\nWhen you ride out alone! in battle-rout\n\n\"Let not my rusting tears make your sword light!\nAh! God of mercy, how he turns away!\nSo, ever must I dress me to the fight;\n\n\"So--let God's justice work! Gauwaine, I say,\nSee me hew down your proofs: yea, all men know\nEven as you said how Mellyagraunce one day,\n\n\"One bitter day in la Fausse Garde, for so\nAll good knights held it after, saw--\nYea, sirs, by cursed unknightly outrage; though\n\n\"You, Gauwaine, held his word without a flaw,\nThis Mellyagraunce saw blood upon my bed--\nWhose blood then pray you? is there any law\n\n\"To make a queen say why some spots of red\nLie on her coverlet? or will you say:\n`Your hands are white, lady, as when you wed,\n\n\" `Where did you bleed?' and I must stammer out: 'Nay,\nI blush indeed, fair lord, only to rend\nMy sleeve up to my shoulder, where there lay\n\n\" `A knife-point last night:' so must I defend\nThe honour of the lady Guenevere?\nNot so, fair lords, even if the world should end\n\n\"This very day, and you were judges here\nInstead of God. Did you see Mellyagraunce\nWhen Launcelot stood by him? what white fear\n\n\"Curdled his blood, and how his teeth did dance,\nHis side sink in? as my knight cried and said:\n'Slayer of unarm'd men, here is a chance!\n\n\" `Setter of traps, I pray you guard your head,\nBy God I am so glad to fight with you,\nStripper of ladies, that my hand feels lead\n\n\" `For driving weight; hurrah now! draw and do,\nFor all my wounds are moving in my breast,\nAnd I am getting mad with waiting so.'\n\n\"He struck his hands together o'er the beast,\nWho fell down flat and grovell'd at his feet,\nAnd groan'd at being slain so young `at least.'\n\n\"My knight said: `Rise you, sir, who are so fleet\nAt catching ladies, half-arm'd will I fight,\nMy left side all uncover'd!' then I weet,\n\n\"Up sprang Sir Mellyagraunce with great delight\nUpon his knave's face; not until just then\nDid I quite hate him, as I saw my knight\n\n\"Along the lists look to my stake and pen\nWith such a joyous smile, it made me sigh\nFrom agony beneath my waist-chain, when\n\n\"The fight began, and to me they drew nigh;\nEver Sir Launcelot kept him on the right,\nAnd traversed warily, and ever high\n\n\"And fast leapt caitiff's sword, until my knight\nSudden threw up his sword to his left hand,\nCaught it, and swung it; that was all the fight,\n\n\"Except a spout of blood on the hot land;\nFor it was hottest summer; and I know\nI wonder'd how the fire, while I should stand,\n\n\"And burn, against the heat, would quiver so,\nYards above my head; thus these matters went;\nWhich things were only warnings of the woe\n\n\"That fell on me. Yet Mellyagraunce was shent,\nFor Mellyagraunce had fought against the Lord;\nTherefore, my lords, take heed lest you be blent\n\n\"With all this wickedness; say no rash word\nAgainst me, being so beautiful; my eyes,\nWept all away to grey, may bring some sword\n\n\"To drown you in your blood; see my breast rise,\nLike waves of purple sea, as here I stand;\nAnd how my arms are moved in wonderful wise,\n\n\"Yea also at my full heart's strong command,\nSee through my long throat how the words go up\nIn ripples to my mouth; how in my hand\n\n\"The shadow lies like wine within a cup\nOf marvellously colour'd gold; yea now\nThis little wind is rising, look you up,\n\n\"And wonder how the light is falling so\nWithin my moving tresses: will you dare\nWhen you have looked a little on my brow,\n\n\"To say this thing is vile? or will you care\nFor any plausible lies of cunning woof,\nWhen you can see my face with no lie there\n\n\"For ever? am I not a gracious proof--\n'But in your chamber Launcelot was found'--\nIs there a good knight then would stand aloof,\n\n\"When a queen says with gentle queenly sound:\n'O true as steel, come now and talk with me,\nI love to see your step upon the ground\n\n\" 'Unwavering, also well I love to see\nThat gracious smile light up your face, and hear\nYour wonderful words, that all mean verily\n\n\" 'The thing they seem to mean: good friend, so dear\nTo me in everything, come here to-night,\nOr else the hours will pass most dull and drear;\n\n\" 'If you come not, I fear this time I might\nGet thinking over much of times gone by,\nWhen I was young, and green hope was in sight:\n\n\" 'For no man cares now to know why I sigh;\nAnd no man comes to sing me pleasant songs,\nNor any brings me the sweet flowers that lie\n\n\" 'So thick in the gardens; therefore one so longs\nTo see you, Launcelot; that we may be\nLike children once again, free from all wrongs\n\n\" 'Just for one night.' Did he not come to me?\nWhat thing could keep true Launcelot away\nIf I said, 'Come?'

told I'll relate the story.\nT'was on the 8th April on the afternoon of that day\nThat the village of Louisburg was thrown into a wild state or dismay,\n\nAnd the villagers flew to the beach in a state of wild uproar\nAnd in a dory they found four men were cast ashore.\nThen the villagers, in surprise assembled about the dory,\nAnd they found that the bottom of the boat was gory;\nThen their hearts were seized with sudden dread,\nwhen they discovered that two of the men were dead.\n\nAnd the two survivors were exhausted from exposure, hunger, and cold,\nWhich used the spectators to shudder when them they did behold;\nAnd with hunger the poor men couldn't stand on their feet,\nThey felt so weakly on their legs for want of meat.\n\nThey were carried to a boarding-house without delay,\nBut those that were looking on were stricken with dismay,\nWhen the remains of James and Angus McDonald were found in the boat,\nLikewise three pieces or flesh in a pool or blood afloat.\n\nAngus McDonald's right arm was missing from the elbow,\nand the throat was cut in a sickening manner which filled the villagers hearts with woe,\nEspecially when they saw two pieces of flesh had been cut from each thigh,\n'Twas then the kind-hearted villagers did murmur and sigh.\n\nAngus McDonald must have felt the pangs of hunger before he did try\nto cut two pieces of fiesh from James McDonald's thigh,\nBut, Oh heaven! the pangs of hunger are very hard to thole,\nAnd anything that's eatable is precious unto an hungry soul.\n\nAlas it is most pitiful and horrible to think\nThat with hunger christians will each other's blood drink\nAnd eat each other's flesh to save themselves from starvation;\nBut the pangs or hunger makes them mad, and drives them to desperation.\n\nAn old American soldier that had passed through the Civil War,\nDeclared the scene surpassed anything he's seen by far,\nAnd at the sight, the crowd in horror turned away,\nwhich no doubt they will remember for many a day.\n\nColin Chisholm, one of the survivors was looking very pale,\nStretched on a sofa at the boarding-house, making his wail:\nPoor fellow! his feet was greatly swollen, and with a melancholy air,\nHe gave the following account of the distressing affair:\n\nWe belonged to the American fishing schooner named \"Cicely\",\nAnd our captain was a brave man, called McKenzie;\nAnd the vessel had fourteen hands altogether\nAnd during the passage we had favourable weather.\n\n'Twas on March the 17th we sailed from Gloucester on the Wednesday\nAnd all our hearts felt buoyant and gay;\nAnd we arrived on the Western banks on the succeeding Tuesday,\nWhile the time unto us seemed to pass merrily away.\n\nAbout eight O'clock in the morning, we left the vessel in a dory,\nAnd I hope all kind christians will take heed to my story;\nWell, while we were at our work, the sky began to frown,\nAnd with a dense fog we were suddenly shut down\n\nThen we hunted and shouted, and every nerve did strain,\nThinking to find our schooner but, alas! it was all in vain:\nBecause the thick fog hid the vessel from our view,\nAnd to keep ourselves warm we closely to each other drew.\n\nWe had not one drop of water , nor provisions of any kind,\nWhich, alas soon began to tell on our mind;\nEspecially upon James McDonald who was very thinly clad,\nAnd with the cold and hunger he felt almost mad.\n\nAnd looking from the stern where he was lying,\nhe said Good bye, mates, Oh! I am dying!\nPoor fellow we kept his body thinking the rest of us would be saved,\nThen, with hunger, Angus McDonald began to cry and madly raved.\n\nAnd he cried, Oh, God! send us some kind of meat,\nBecause I'm resolved to have something to eat;\nOh! do not let us starve on the briny flood\nOr else I will drink of poor Jim's blood.\n\nThen he suddenly seized his knife and cut off poor Jim's arm,\nNot thinking in his madness he'd done any harm;\nThen poor Jim's blood he did drink and his flesh did eat,\nDeclaring that the blood tasted like cream, and was a treat.\n\nThen he asked me to taste it, saying It was good without doubt,\nThen I tasted it, but in disgust I instantly spat it out;\nSaying, if I was to die within an hour on the briny flood,\nI would neither eat the flesh nor drink the blood.\n\nThen in the afternoon again he turned to me,\nSaying, I'm going to cut Jim's throat for more blood d'ye see;\nThen I begged of him, for God's sake not to cut the throat of poor Jim,\nBut he cried, Ha! ha! to save my own life I consider it no sin.\n\nI tried to prevent him but he struck me without dismay\nAnd cut poor Jim's throat in defiance of me, or all I could say,\nAlso a piece of flesh from each thigh, and began to eat away,\nBut poor fellow he sickened about noon, and died on the Sunday.\n\nNow it is all over and I will thank all my life,\nWho has preserved me and my mate, McEachern, in the midst of danger and strife;\nAnd I hope that all landsmen of low and high degree,\nWill think of the hardships of poor mariners while at sea.","title":"A Tale of the

thereof no doubt drove him mad.\n\nThen he fled from London without delay,\nKnowing he wouldn't be safe there night nor day,\nAnd embarked on board a ship bound for Spain,\nThinking he would escape detection there, but 'twas all in vain.\n\nBecause while staying at a hotel in Spain\nHe appeared to the landlord to be a little insane.\nAnd he noticed he was always seemingly in dread,\nLike a

was blinded by his own conceit.\nAnd would have robbed his dearest friend all for good meat,\nTo satisfy his gluttony and his own sensual indulgence,\nWhich the inhuman monster considered no great offence.\n\nBut now in that undiscovered country he's getting his reward,\nAnd I'm sure few people have for him little regard,\nBecause he was a villain of the deepest dye,\nAnd but few people for him will heave a sigh.\n\nWhen I think of such a monster my blood runs cold,\nHe was like Monteith, that betrayed Wallace for English gold;\nBut I hope Parnell will prosper for many a day\nIn despite of his enemies that fried to swear his life away.\n\nOh! think of his sufferings and how manfully he did stand.\nDuring his long trial in London, to me it seems grand.\nTo see him standing at the bar, innocent and upright,\nQuite cool and defiant, a most beautiful sight.\n\nAnd to the noble patriot, honour be it said,\nHe never was the least afraid\nTo speak on behalf of Home Rule for Ireland,\nBut like a true patriot nobly he did take his stand.\n\nAnd may he go on conquering and conquer to the end,\nAnd hoping that God will the right defend,\nAnd protect him always by night and by day,\nAt home and abroad when far away.\n\nAnd now since he's set free, Ireland's sons should rejoice\nAnd applaud him to the skies, all with one voice,\nFor he's their patriot, true and bold,\nAnd an honest,
